/// Arrays are one of the most commonly used data types in an app. You use
/// arrays to organize your app's data. Specifically, you use the `Array`
/// type to hold elements of a single type, the array's `Element` type. An
/// array's elements can be anything from an integer to a string to a
/// class.
///
/// Swift makes it easy to create arrays in your code using an array
/// literal: simply surround a comma-separated list of values with square
/// brackets. Without any other information, Swift creates an array that
/// includes the specified values, automatically inferring the array's
/// `Element` type. For example:
///
///     // An array of 'Int' elements
///     let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
///
///     // An array of 'String' elements
///     let streets = ["Albemarle", "Brandywine", "Chesapeake"]
///
/// You can create an empty array by specifying the `Element` type of your
/// array in the declaration. For example:
///
///     // Shortened forms are preferred
///     var emptyDoubles: [Double] = []
///
///     // The full type name is also allowed
///     var emptyFloats: Array<Float> = Array()
///
/// If you need an array that is preinitialized with a fixed number of
/// default values, use the `Array(repeating:count:)` initializer.
///
///     var digitCounts = Array(repeating: 0, count: 10)
///     print(digitCounts)
///     // Prints "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
///
/// Accessing Array Values
/// ======================
///
/// When you need to perform an operation on all of an array's elements, use
/// a `for`-`in` loop to iterate through the array's contents.
///
///     for street in streets {
///         print("I don't live on \(street).")
///     }
///     // Prints "I don't live on Albemarle."
///     // Prints "I don't live on Brandywine."
///     // Prints "I don't live on Chesapeake."
///
/// Use the `isEmpty` property to check quickly whether an array has any
/// elements, or use the `count` property to find the number of elements in
/// the array.
///
///     if oddNumbers.isEmpty {
///         print("I don't know any odd numbers.")
///     } else {
///         print("I know \(oddNumbers.count) odd numbers.")
///     }
///     // Prints "I know 8 odd numbers."
///
/// Use the `first` and `last` properties for safe access to the value of the
/// array's first and last elements. If the array is empty, these properties
/// are `nil`.
///
///     print(oddNumbers.first, oddNumbers.last, separator=", ")
///     // Prints "1, 15"
///
///     print(emptyDoubles.first, emptyDoubles.last, separator=", ")
///     // Prints "nil, nil"
///
/// You can access individual array elements through a subscript. The first
/// element of a nonempty array is always at index zero. You can
/// subscript an array with any integer from zero up to, but not including,
/// the count of the array. Using a negative number or an index equal to or
/// greater than `count` triggers a runtime error. For example:
///
///     print(oddNumbers[0], oddNumbers[3], separator=", ")
///     // Prints "1, 7"
///
///     print(emptyDoubles[0])
///     // Triggers runtime error: Index out of range
///
/// See the `Sequence`, `Collection`, and `RangeReplaceableCollection`
/// protocols for more methods available to arrays.
///
/// Adding and Removing Elements
/// ============================
///
/// Suppose you need to store a list of the names of students that are
/// signed up for a class you're teaching. During the registration period,
/// you need to add and remove names as students add and drop the class.
///
///     var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell"]
///
/// More students are signing up. Add single elements to the end of an array
/// by using the `append(_:)` method. Add multiple elements at once by passing
/// another array or a sequence of any kind to the `append(contentsOf:)`
/// method.
///
///     students.append("Maxime")
///     students.append(contentsOf: ["Shakia", "William"])
///
///     print(students)
///     // Prints "["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Maxime", "Shakia", "William"]"
///
/// Another last-minute addition! Add new elements into the middle of the
/// array by using the `insert(_:at:)` method for single elements and
/// by using `insert(contentsOf:at:)` to insert multiple elements from another
/// collection or array literal. The elements at that index and later are
/// shifted back to make room.
///
///     // Welcome, Liam!
///     students.insert("Liam", at: 3)
///
/// A couple of students can't take your class after all. Use the
/// `removeLast()` and `remove(at:)` methods to remove their names
/// from the array.
///
///     // Ben's family is moving to another state
///     students.remove(at: 0)
///
///     // William is signing up for a different class
///     students.removeLast()
///
///     print(students)
///     // Prints "["Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Maxime", "Shakia"]"
///
/// On the first day, you learn that Maxime really prefers to go by Max.
/// Replace an existing element with a new value by assigning to the
/// subscript.
///
///     if let i = students.index(of: "Maxime") {
///         students[i] = "Max"
///     }
///
/// Growing the Size of an Array
/// ----------------------------
///
/// Every array reserves a specific amount of memory to hold its contents. When
/// you add elements to an array and that array begins to exceed its reserved
/// capacity, the array allocates a larger region of memory and copies its
/// elements into the new storage. The new storage is a multiple of the
/// old storage's size. This exponential growth strategy means that appending
/// an element happens in constant time, averaging the performance of many
/// append operations. Append operations that trigger reallocation have a
/// performance cost, but they occur less and less often as the array grows
/// larger.
///
/// If you know approximately how many elements you will need to store, use
/// the `reserveCapacity(_:)` method before appending to the array to avoid
/// intermediate reallocations. Use the `capacity` and `count` properties
/// to determine how many more elements the array can store without
/// allocating larger storage.
///
/// For arrays of most `Element` types, this storage is a contiguous block
/// of memory. For arrays with an `Element` type that is a class or `@objc`
/// protocol type, this storage can be a contiguous block of memory or an
/// instance of `NSArray`. Because any arbitrary subclass of `NSArray` can
/// become an `Array`, there are no guarantees about representation or
/// efficiency in this case.
///
/// Modifying Copies of Arrays
/// ==========================
///
/// Each array has an independent value that includes the values of all of
/// its elements. For simple types such as integers and other structures,
/// this means that when you change a value in one array, the value of that
/// element does not change in any copies of the array. For example:
///
///     var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///     var numbersCopy = numbers
///     numbers[0] = 100
///     print(numbers)
///     // Prints "[100, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
///     print(numbersCopy)
///     // Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
///
/// If the elements in an array are instances of a class, the semantics are
/// the same, though they might appear different at first. In this case,
/// the values stored in the array are references to objects that live
/// outside the array. If you change a reference to an object in one array,
/// only that array has a reference to the new object. However, if two
/// arrays contain references to the same object, you can observe changes
/// to that object's properties from both arrays. For example:
///
///     // An integer type with reference semantics
///     class IntegerReference {
///         var value = 10
///     }
///     var firstIntegers = [IntegerReference(), IntegerReference()]
///     var secondIntegers = firstIntegers
///
///     // Modifications to an instance are visible from either array
///     firstIntegers[0].value = 100
///     print(secondIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "100"
///
///     // Replacements, additions, and removals are still visible
///     // only in the modified array
///     firstIntegers[0] = IntegerReference()
///     print(firstIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "10"
///     print(secondIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "100"
///
/// Arrays, like all variable-size collections in the standard library, use
/// copy-on-write optimization. Multiple copies of an array share the same
/// storage until you modify one of the copies. When that happens, the
/// array being modified replaces its storage with a uniquely owned copy of
/// itself, which is then modified in place. Optimizations are sometimes
/// applied that can reduce the amount of copying.
///
/// This means that if an array is sharing storage with other copies, the
/// first mutating operation on that array incurs the cost of copying the
/// array. An array that is the sole owner of its storage can perform
/// mutating operations in place.
///
/// In the example below, a `numbers` array is created along with two copies
/// that share the same storage. When the original `numbers` array is
/// modified, it makes a unique copy of its storage before making the
/// modification. Further modifications to `numbers` are made in place,
/// while the two copies continue to share the original storage.
///
///     var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///     var firstCopy = numbers
///     var secondCopy = numbers
///
///     // The storage for 'numbers' is copied here
///     numbers[0] = 100
///     numbers[1] = 200
///     numbers[2] = 300
///     // 'numbers' is [100, 200, 300, 4, 5]
///     // 'firstCopy' and 'secondCopy' are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///
/// Bridging Between Array and NSArray
/// ==================================
///
/// When you need to access APIs that expect data in an `NSArray` instance
/// instead of `Array`, use the type-cast operator (`as`) to bridge your
/// instance. For bridging to be possible, the `Element` type of your array
/// must be a class, an `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C
/// or marked with the `@objc` attribute), or a type that bridges to a
/// Foundation type.
///
/// The following example shows how you can bridge an `Array` instance to
/// `NSArray` to use the `write(to:atomically:)` method. In this
/// example, the `colors` array can be bridged to `NSArray` because its
/// `String` elements bridge to `NSString`. The compiler prevents bridging
/// the `moreColors` array, on the other hand, because its `Element` type
/// is `Optional<String>`, which does *not* bridge to a Foundation type.
///
///     let colors = ["periwinkle", "rose", "moss"]
///     let moreColors: [String?] = ["ochre", "pine"]
///
///     let url = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: "names.plist")
///     (colors as NSArray).write(to: url, atomically: true)
///     // true
///
///     (moreColors as NSArray).write(to: url, atomically: true)
///     // error: cannot convert value of type '[String?]' to type 'NSArray'
///
/// Bridging from `Array` to `NSArray` takes O(1) time and O(1) space if the
/// array's elements are already instances of a class or an `@objc`
/// protocol; otherwise, it takes O(n) time and space.
///
/// Bridging from `NSArray` to `Array` first calls the `copy(with:)`
/// (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) method on the array to get an immutable
/// copy and then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1)
/// time. For instances of `NSArray` that are already immutable,
/// `copy(with:)` usually returns the same array in O(1) time; otherwise,
/// the copying performance is unspecified. The instances of `NSArray` and
/// `Array` share storage using the same copy-on-write optimization that is
/// used when two instances of `Array` share storage.
///
/// - Note: The `ContiguousArray` and `ArraySlice` types are not bridged;

/// A type that can be initialized using an array literal.

/// anywhere an instance of an `ArrayLiteralConvertible` type is expected: as
/// a value assigned to a variable or constant, as a parameter to a method or
/// initializer, or even as the subject of a nonmutating operation like
/// `map(_:)` or `filter(_:)`.
///
/// Arrays, sets, and option sets all conform to `ArrayLiteralConvertible`, and
/// your own custom types can as well. Here's an example of creating a set and
/// an array using array literals:
///
///     let employeesSet: Set<String> = ["Amir", "Jihye", "Dave", "Alessia", "Dave"]
///     print(employeesSet)
///     // Prints "["Amir", "Dave", "Jihye", "Alessia"]"

///     print(employeesArray)
///     // Prints "["Amir", "Jihye", "Dave", "Alessia", "Dave"]"
///
/// The `Set` and `Array` types each handle array literals in their own way to
/// create new instances. In this case, the newly created set drops the
/// duplicate value ("Dave") and doesn't maintain the order of the array
/// literal's elements. The new array, on the other hand, matches the order
/// and number of elements provided.
///
/// - Note: An array literal is not the same as an `Array` instance. You can't
///   initialize a type that conforms to `ArrayLiteralConvertible` simply by
///   assigning an existing array.
///
///         let anotherSet: Set = employeesArray
///         // error: cannot convert value of type '[String]' to specified type 'Set'
///
/// Type Inference of Array Literals
/// ================================
///
/// Whenever possible, Swift's compiler infers the full intended type of your
/// array literal. Because `Array` is the default type for an array literal,
/// without writing any other code, you can declare an array with a particular
/// element type by providing one or more values.
///
/// In this example, the compiler infers the full type of each array literal.
///
///     let integers = [1, 2, 3]
///     // 'integers' has type '[Int]'
///
///     let strings = ["a", "b", "c"]
///     // 'strings' has type '[String]'
///
/// An empty array literal alone doesn't provide enough information for the
/// compiler to infer the intended type of the `Array` instance. When using an
/// empty array literal, specify the type of the variable or constant.
///
///     var emptyArray: [Bool] = []
///     // 'emptyArray' has type '[Bool]'
///
/// Because many functions and initializers fully specify the types of their
/// parameters, you can often use an array literal with or without elements as
/// a parameter. For example, the `sum(_:)` function shown here takes an `Int`
/// array as a parameter:
///
///     func sum(values: [Int]) -> Int {
///         return values.reduce(0, combine: +)
///     }
///
///     let sumOfFour = sum([5, 10, 15, 20])
///     // 'sumOfFour' == 50
///
///     let sumOfNone = sum([])
///     // 'sumOfNone' == 0
///
/// When you call a function that does not fully specify its parameters' types,
/// use the type-cast operator (`as`) to specify the type of an array literal.
/// For example, the `log(name:value:)` function shown here has an
/// unconstrained generic `value` parameter.
///
///     func log<T>(name name: String, value: T) {
///         print("\(name): \(value)")
///     }
///
///     log(name: "Four integers", value: [5, 10, 15, 20])
///     // Prints "Four integers: [5, 10, 15, 20]"
///
///     log(name: "Zero integers", value: [] as [Int])
///     // Prints "Zero integers: []"
///
/// Conforming to ArrayLiteralConvertible
/// =====================================
///
/// Add the capability to be initialized with an array literal to your own
/// custom types by declaring an `init(arrayLiteral:)` initializer. The

/// A slice of an `Array`, `ContiguousArray`, or `ArraySlice` instance.
///
/// The `ArraySlice` type makes it fast and efficient for you to perform
/// operations on sections of a larger array. Instead of copying over the
/// elements of a slice to new storage, an `ArraySlice` instance presents a
/// view onto the storage of a larger array. And because `ArraySlice`
/// presents the same interface as `Array`, you can generally perform the
/// same operations on a slice as you could on the original array.
///
/// For more information about using arrays, see `Array` and `ContiguousArray`,
/// with which `ArraySlice` shares most properties and methods.
///
/// Slices Are Views onto Arrays
/// ============================
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences
/// from each class during a session.
///
///     let absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You want to compare the absences in the first half of the session with
/// those in the second half. To do so, start by creating two slices of the
/// `absences` array.
///
///     let midpoint = absences.count / 2
///
///     let firstHalf = absences.prefix(upTo: midpoint)
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(from: midpoint)
///
/// Neither the `firstHalf` nor `secondHalf` slices allocate any new storage
/// of their own. Instead, each presents a view onto the storage of the
/// `absences` array.
///
/// You can call any method on the slices that you might have called on the
/// `absences` array. To learn which half had more absences, use the
/// `reduce(_:combine:)` method to calculate each sum.
///
///     let firstHalfSum = firstHalf.reduce(0, combine: +)
///     let secondHalfSum = secondHalf.reduce(0, combine: +)
///
///     if firstHalfSum > secondHalfSum {
///         print("More absences in the first half.")
///     } else {
///         print("More absences in the second half.")
///     }
///     // Prints "More absences in the second half."
///
/// - Important: Long-term storage of `ArraySlice` instances is discouraged. A
///   slice holds a reference to the entire storage of a larger array, not
///   just to the portion it presents, even after the original array's lifetime
///   ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore prolong the lifetime of
///   elements that are no longer otherwise accessible, which can appear to be
///   memory and object leakage.
///
/// Slices Maintain Indices
/// =======================
///
/// Unlike `Array` and `ContiguousArray`, the starting index for an
/// `ArraySlice` instance isn't always zero. Slices maintain the same
/// indices of the larger array for the same elements, so the starting
/// index of a slice depends on how it was created, letting you perform
/// index-based operations on either a full array or a slice.
///
/// Sharing indices between collections and their subsequences is an important
/// part of the design of Swift's collection algorithms. Suppose you are
/// tasked with finding the first two days with absences in the session. To
/// find the indices of the two days in question, follow these steps:
///
/// 1) Call `index(where:)` to find the index of the first element in the
///    `absences` array that is greater than zero.
/// 2) Create a slice of the `absences` array starting after the index found in
///    step 1.
/// 3) Call `index(where:)` again, this time on the slice created in step 2.
///    Where in some languages you might pass a starting index into an
///    `indexOf` method to find the second day, in Swift you perform the same
///    operation on a slice of the original array.
/// 4) Print the results using the indices found in steps 1 and 3 on the
///    original `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     if let i = absences.index(where: { $0 > 0 }) {                      // 1
///         let absencesAfterFirst = absences.suffix(from: i + 1)           // 2
///         if let j = absencesAfterFirst.index(where: { $0 > 0 }) {        // 3
///             print("The first day with absences had \(absences[i]).")    // 4
///             print("The second day with absences had \(absences[j]).")
///         }
///     }
///     // Prints "The first day with absences had 2."
///     // Prints "The second day with absences had 4."
///
/// In particular, note that `j`, the index of the second day with absences,
/// was found in a slice of the original array and then used to access a value
/// in the original `absences` array itself.
///
/// - Note: To safely reference the starting and ending indices of a slice,
///   always use the `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties instead of
///   specific values.

/// Collections are used extensively throughout the standard library. When

/// types, you benefit from the operations that the `Collection` protocol
/// declares and implements.
///
/// In addition to the methods that collections inherit from the `Sequence`
/// protocol, you gain access to methods that depend on accessing an element
/// at a specific position when using a collection.
///
/// For example, if you want to print only the first word in a string,
/// search for the index of the first space, and then create a subsequence up
/// to that position.
///
///     let text = "Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo."
///     if let firstSpace = text.characters.index(of: " ") {
///         print(String(text.characters.prefix(upTo: firstSpace)))
///     }
///     // Prints "Buffalo"
///
/// The `firstSpace` constant is an index into the `text.characters`
/// collection. `firstSpace` is the position of the first space in the
/// collection. You can store indices in variables, and pass them to
/// collection algorithms or use them later to access the corresponding
/// element. In the example above, `firstSpace` is used to extract the prefix
/// that contains elements up to that index.
///
/// You can pass only valid indices to collection operations. You can find a
/// complete set of a collection's valid indices by starting with the
/// collection's `startIndex` property and finding every successor up to, and
/// including, the `endIndex` property. All other values of the `Index` type,
/// such as the `startIndex` property of a different collection, are invalid
/// indices for this collection.
///
/// Saved indices may become invalid as a result of mutating operations; for
/// more information about index invalidation in mutable collections, see the
/// reference for the `MutableCollection` and `RangeReplaceableCollection`
/// protocols, as well as for the specific type you're using.
///
/// Accessing Individual Elements
/// =============================
///
/// You can access an element of a collection through its subscript with any
/// valid index except the collection's `endIndex` property, a "past-the-end"
/// index that does not correspond with any element of the collection.
///
/// Here's an example of accessing the first character in a string through its
/// subscript:
///
///     let firstChar = text.characters[text.characters.startIndex]
///     print(firstChar)
///     // Prints "B"
///
/// The `Collection` protocol declares and provides default implementations
/// for many operations that depend on elements being accessible by their
/// subscript. For example, you can also access the first character of
/// `text` using the `first` property, which has the value of the first
/// element of the collection, or `nil` if the collection is empty.
///
///     print(text.characters.first)
///     // Prints "Optional("B")"
///
/// Traversing a Collection 
/// =======================
///
/// While a sequence may be consumed as it is traversed, a collection is
/// guaranteed to be multi-pass: Any element may be repeatedly accessed by
/// saving its index. Moreover, a collection's indices form a finite range
/// of the positions of the collection's elements. This guarantees the
/// safety of operations that depend on a sequence being finite, such as
/// checking to see whether a collection contains an element.
///
/// Iterating over the elements of a collection by their positions yields the
/// same elements in the same order as iterating over that collection using
/// its iterator. This example demonstrates that the `characters` view of a
/// string returns the same characters in the same order whether the view's
/// indices or the view itself is being iterated.
///
///     let word = "Swift"
///     for character in word.characters {
///         print(character)
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
/// 
///     for i in word.characters.indices {
///         print(word.characters[i])
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
///
/// Conforming to the Collection Protocol 
/// =====================================
///
/// If you create a custom type that can provide repeated access to its
/// elements, conformance to the `Collection` protocol gives your
/// custom type a more useful and more efficient interface for sequence and
/// collection operations. To add conformance to your type, declare
/// `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties and a subscript that provides at
/// least read-only access to your type's elements.
///
/// Expected Performance
/// ====================
///
/// Types that conform to `Collection` are expected to provide the
/// `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties and subscript access to elements
/// as O(1) operations. Types that are not able to guarantee that expected
/// performance must document the departure, because many collection operations
/// depend on O(1) subscripting performance for their own performance
/// guarantees.
///
/// The performance of some collection operations depends on the type of index
/// that the collection provides. For example, a random-access collection,
/// which can measure the distance between two indices in O(1) time, will be
/// able to calculate its `count` property in O(1) time. Conversely, because a
/// forward or bidirectional collection must traverse the entire collection to
/// count the number of contained elements, accessing its `count` property is
/// an O(N) operation.

/// The `IteratorProtocol` protocol is tightly linked with the `Sequence`
/// protocol. Sequences provide access to their elements by creating an
/// iterator, which keeps track of its iteration process and returns one
/// element at a time as it advances through the sequence.
///
/// Whenever you use a `for`-`in` loop with an array, set, or any other
/// collection or sequence, you're using that type's iterator. Swift uses a
/// sequence's or collection's iterator internally to enable the `for`-`in`
/// loop language construct.
///
/// Using a sequence's iterator directly gives you access to the same elements
/// in the same order as iterating over that sequence using a `for`-`in` loop.
/// For example, you might typically use a `for`-`in` loop to print each of
/// the elements in an array.
///
///     let animals = ["Antelope", "Butterfly", "Camel", "Dolphin"]
///     for animal in animals {
///         print(animal)
///     }
///     // Prints "Antelope"
///     // Prints "Butterfly"
///     // Prints "Camel"
///     // Prints "Dolphin"
///
/// Behind the scenes, Swift uses the `animals` array's iterator to loop over
/// the contents of the array.
///
///     var animalIterator = animals.makeIterator()
///     while let animal = animalIterator.next() {
///         print(animal)
///     }
///     // Prints "Antelope"
///     // Prints "Butterfly"
///     // Prints "Camel"
///     // Prints "Dolphin"
///
/// The call to `animals.makeIterator()` returns an instance of the array's
/// iterator. Next, the `while` loop calls the iterator's `next()` method
/// repeatedly, binding each element that is returned to `animal` and exiting
/// when the `next()` method returns `nil`.
///
/// Using Iterators Directly
/// ========================
///
/// You rarely need to use iterators directly, because a `for`-`in` loop is the
/// more idiomatic approach to traversing a sequence in Swift. Some
/// algorithms, however, may call for direct iterator use.
///
/// One example is the `reduce1(_:)` method. Similar to the
/// `reduce(_:combine:)` method defined in the standard library, which takes
/// an initial value and a combining closure, `reduce1(_:)` uses the first
/// element of the sequence as the initial value.
///
/// Here's an implementation of the `reduce1(_:)` method. The sequence's
/// iterator is used directly to retrieve the initial value before looping
/// over the rest of the sequence.
///
///     extension Sequence {
///         func reduce1(
///           combine: (Iterator.Element, Iterator.Element) -> Iterator.Element
///         ) -> Iterator.Element?
///         {
///             var i = makeIterator()
///             guard var accumulated = i.next() else {
///                 return nil
///             }
///
///             while let element = i.next() {
///                 accumulated = combine(accumulated, element)
///             }
///             return accumulated
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `reduce1(_:)` method makes certain kinds of sequence operations
/// simpler. Here's how to find the longest string in a sequence, using the
/// `animals` array introduced earlier as an example:
///
///     let longestAnimal = animals.reduce1 { current, element in
///         if current.characters.count > element.characters.count {
///             return current
///         } else {
///             return element
///         }
///     }
///     print(longestAnimal)
///     // Prints "Butterfly"
///
/// Using Multiple Iterators
/// ========================
///
/// Whenever you use multiple iterators (or `for`-`in` loops) over a single
/// sequence, be sure you know that the specific sequence supports repeated
/// iteration, either because you know its concrete type or because the
/// sequence is also constrained to the `Collection` protocol.
///
/// Obtain each separate iterator from separate calls to the sequence's
/// `makeIterator()` method rather than by copying. Copying an iterator is
/// safe, but advancing one copy of an iterator by calling its `next()` method
/// may invalidate other copies of that iterator. `for`-`in` loops are safe in
/// this regard.
///
/// Adding IteratorProtocol Conformance to Your Type
/// ================================================
///
/// Implementing an iterator that conforms to `IteratorProtocol` is simple.
/// Declare a `next()` method that advances one step in the related sequence
/// and returns the current element. When the sequence has been exhausted, the
/// `next()` method returns `nil`.
///
/// For example, consider a custom `Countdown` sequence. You can initialize the
/// `Countdown` sequence with a starting integer and then iterate over the
/// count down to zero. The `Countdown` structure's definition is short: It
/// contains only the starting count and the `makeIterator()` method required
/// by the `Sequence` protocol.
///
///     struct Countdown: Sequence {
///         let start: Int
///
///         func makeIterator() -> CountdownIterator {
///             return CountdownIterator(self)
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `makeIterator()` method returns another custom type, an iterator named
/// `CountdownIterator`. The `CountdownIterator` type keeps track of both the
/// `Countdown` sequence that it's iterating and the number of times it has
/// returned a value.
///
///     struct CountdownIterator: IteratorProtocol {
///         let countdown: Countdown
///         var times = 0
///
///         init(_ countdown: Countdown) {
///             self.countdown = countdown
///         }
///
///         mutating func next() -> Int? {
///             let nextNumber = countdown.start - times
///             guard nextNumber > 0
///                 else { return nil }
///
///             times += 1
///             return nextNumber
///         }
///     }
///
/// Each time the `next()` method is called on a `CountdownIterator` instance,
/// it calculates the new next value, checks to see whether it has reached
/// zero, and then returns either the number, or `nil` if the iterator is
/// finished returning elements of the sequence.
///
/// Creating and iterating over a `Countdown` sequence uses a
/// `CountdownGenerator` to handle the iteration.
///
///     let threeTwoOne = Countdown(start: 3)
///     for count in threeTwoOne {
///         print("\(count)...")

/// A type that can be converted to and from an associated raw value.
///
/// With a `RawRepresentable` type, you can switch back and forth between a
/// custom type and an associated `RawValue` type without losing the value of
/// the original `RawRepresentable` type. Using the raw value of a conforming
/// type streamlines interoperation with Objective-C and legacy APIs and
/// simplifies conformance to other protocols, such as `Equatable`,
/// `Comparable`, and `Hashable`.
///
/// The `RawRepresentable` protocol is seen mainly in two categories of types:
/// enumerations with raw value types and option sets.
///
/// Enumerations with Raw Values
/// ============================
///
/// For any enumeration with a string, integer, or floating-point raw type, the
/// Swift compiler automatically adds `RawRepresentable` conformance. When
/// defining your own custom enumeration, you give it a raw type by specifying
/// the raw type as the first item in the enumeration's type inheritance list.
/// You can also use literals to specify values for one or more cases.
///
/// For example, the `Counter` enumeration defined here has an `Int` raw value
/// type and gives the first case a raw value of `1`:
///
///     enum Counter: Int {
///         case one = 1, two, three, four, five
///     }
///
/// You can create a `Counter` instance from an integer value between 1 and 5
/// by using the `init?(rawValue:)` initializer declared in the
/// `RawRepresentable` protocol. This initializer is failable because although
/// every case of the `Counter` type has a corresponding `Int` value, there
/// are many `Int` values that *don't* correspond to a case of `Counter`.
///
///     for i in 3...6 {
///         print(Counter(rawValue: i))
///     }
///     // Prints "Optional(Counter.three)"
///     // Prints "Optional(Counter.four)"
///     // Prints "Optional(Counter.five)"
///     // Prints "nil"
///
/// Option Sets
/// ===========
///
/// Option sets all conform to `RawRepresentable` by inheritance using the
/// `OptionSet` protocol. Whether using an option set or creating your own,
/// you use the raw value of an option set instance to store the instance's
/// bitfield. The raw value must therefore be of a type that conforms to the
/// `BitwiseOperations` protocol, such as `UInt8` or `Int`. For example, the
/// `Direction` type defines an option set for the four directions you can
/// move in a game.
///
///     struct Directions: OptionSet {
///         let rawValue: UInt8
///
///         static let up    = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 0)
///         static let down  = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 1)
///         static let left  = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 2)
///         static let right = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 3)
///     }
///
/// Unlike enumerations, option sets provide a nonfailable `init(rawValue:)`
/// initializer to convert from a raw value, because option sets don't have an
/// enumerated list of all possible cases. Option set values have
/// a one-to-one correspondence with their associated raw values.
///
/// In the case of the `Directions` option set, an instance can contain zero,
/// one, or more of the four defined directions. This example declares a
/// constant with three currently allowed moves. The raw value of the
/// `allowedMoves` instance is the result of the bitwise `OR` of its three
/// members' raw values:
///
///     let allowedMoves: Directions = [.up, .down, .left]
///     print(allowedMoves.rawValue)
///     // Prints "7"
///
/// Option sets use bitwise operations on their associated raw values to
/// implement their mathematical set operations. For example, the `contains()`
/// method on `allowedMoves` performs a bitwise `AND` operation to check
/// whether the option set contains an element.
///
///     print(allowedMoves.contains(.right))
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(allowedMoves.rawValue & Directions.right.rawValue)
///     // Prints "0"
///

/// A type that provides sequential, iterated access to its elements.
///
/// Sequences are lists of values that let you step over their values
/// one at a time. The most common way to iterate over the elements of a
/// sequence is to use a `for`-`in` loop:
///
///     let oneTwoThree = 1...3
///     for number in oneTwoThree {
///         print(number)
///     }
///     // Prints "1"
///     // Prints "2"
///     // Prints "3"
///
/// While seemingly simple, this capability gives you access to a large number
/// of operations that you can perform on any sequence. As an example, to
/// check whether a sequence includes a particular value, you can test each
/// value sequentially until you've found a match or reached the end of the
/// sequence. This example checks to see whether a particular insect is in an
/// array.
///
///     let bugs = ["Aphid", "Bumblebee", "Cicada", "Damselfly", "Earwig"]
///     var hasMosquito = false
///     for bug in bugs {
///         if bug == "Mosquito" {
///             hasMosquito = true
///             break
///         }
///     }
///     print("'bugs' has a mosquito: \(hasMosquito)")
///     // Prints "'bugs' has a mosquito: false"
///
/// The `Sequence` protocol provides default implementations for many common
/// operations that depend on sequential access to a sequence's values. For
/// clearer, more concise code, the example above could use the array's
/// `contains(_:)` method, which every sequence inherits from `Sequence`,
/// instead of iterating manually:
///
///     if bugs.contains("Mosquito") {
///         print("Break out the bug spray.")
///     } else {
///         print("Whew, no mosquitos!")
///     }
///     // Prints "Whew, no mosquitos!"
///
/// Repeated Access 
/// ===============
///
/// The `Sequence` protocol makes no requirement on conforming types regarding
/// whether they will be destructively "consumed" by iteration. As a
/// consequence, don't assume that multiple `for`-`in` loops on a sequence
/// will either "resume" iteration or restart from the beginning:
///
///     for element in sequence {
///         if ... some condition { break }
///     }
/// 
///     for element in sequence {
///         // No defined behavior
///     }
///
/// In this case, you cannot assume that a sequence will either be
/// "consumable" and will resume iteration, or that a sequence is a
/// collection and will restart iteration from the first element. A
/// conforming sequence that is not a collection is allowed to produce an
/// arbitrary sequence of elements in the second `for`-`in` loop.
///
/// To establish that a type you've created supports nondestructive
/// iteration, add conformance to the `Collection` protocol.
///
/// Conforming to the Sequence Protocol 
/// ===================================
///
/// Making your own custom types conform to `Sequence` enables many useful
/// operations, like `for`-`in` looping and the `contains` method, without
/// much effort. To add `Sequence` conformance to your own custom type, add
/// a `makeIterator()` method that returns an iterator.
///
/// Alternatively, if your type can act as its own iterator, implementing the
/// requirements of the `IteratorProtocol` protocol and declaring conformance
/// to both `Sequence` and `IteratorProtocol` are sufficient.
///
/// Here's a definition of a `Countdown` sequence that serves as its own
/// iterator. The `makeIterator()` method is provided as a default
/// implementation.
///
///     struct Countdown: Sequence, IteratorProtocol {
///         var count: Int
/// 
///         mutating func next() -> Int? {
///             if count == 0 {
///                 return nil
///             } else {
///                 defer { count -= 1 }
///                 return count
///             }

///         print(i)

///     // Prints "2"
///     // Prints "1"

/// ==============
///
/// Sets provide a suite of mathematical set operations. For example, you can

/// - Use the `contains(_:)` method to test whether a set contains a specific
///   element.
/// - Use the `==` operator to test whether two sets contain the same elements.
/// - Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to test whether a set contains all the
///   elements of another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to test whether all elements of a set
///   are contained in another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` and `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods to
///   test whether a set is a subset or superset of, but not equal to, another
///   set.
/// - Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to test whether a set has any
///   elements in common with another set.
///
/// You can also combine, exclude, or subtract the elements of two sets:
///
/// - Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of a set
///   and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the elements
///   common to a set and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements
///   that are in either a set or another set or sequence, but not in both.
/// - Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of a
///   set that are not also in another set or sequence.
///
/// You can modify a set in place by using these methods' mutating
/// counterparts: `formUnion(_:)`, `formIntersection(_:)`,
/// `formSymmetricDifference(_:)`, and `subtract(_:)`.
///
/// Set operations are not limited to use with other sets. Instead, you can
/// perform set operations with another set, an array, or any other sequence
/// type.
///
///     var primes: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

///     let favoriteNumbers = [5, 7, 15, 21]

///     // Prints "[5, 7]"
///
///
/// Sequence and Collection Operations
/// ==================================
///
/// In addition to the `Set` type's set operations, you can use any nonmutating
/// sequence or collection methods with a set.
///
///     if primes.isEmpty {
///         print("No primes!")

///     // 'primesSum' == 17
///
///     let primeStrings = primes.sorted().map(String.init)
///     // 'primeStrings' == ["2", "3", "5", "7"]

/// Bridging Between Set and NSSet
/// ==============================

/// You can bridge between `Set` and `NSSet` using the `as` operator. For

/// `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C or marked with the

/// set's `Element` type is neither a class nor an `@objc` protocol, any
/// required bridging of elements occurs at the first access of each element,
/// so the first operation that uses the contents of the set (for example, a
/// membership test) can take O(N).
///
/// Bridging from `NSSet` to `Set` first calls the `copy(with:)` method
/// (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the set to get an immutable copy and
/// then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1) time. For
/// instances of `NSSet` that are already immutable, `copy(with:)` returns the
/// same set in constant time; otherwise, the copying performance is
/// unspecified. The instances of `NSSet` and `Set` share storage using the

/// `SetAlgebra` protocol, `x` and `y` are instances of `S`, and `e` is of
/// type `S.Element`---the type that the set holds.

/// - `x.intersection(x) == x`
/// - `x.intersection([]) == []`
/// - `x.union(x) == x`
/// - `x.union([]) == x`
/// - `x.contains(e)` implies `x.union(y).contains(e)`
/// - `x.union(y).contains(e)` implies `x.contains(e) || y.contains(e)`

/// Unicode-Correct
/// ===============
///
/// Swift strings are designed to be Unicode-correct.  In particular,
/// the APIs make it easy to write code that works correctly, and does
/// not surprise end-users, regardless of where you venture in the
/// Unicode character space.  For example, the `==` operator checks
/// for [Unicode canonical
/// equivalence](http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#deterministic_comparison),
/// so two different representations of the same string will always
/// compare equal.
///
/// Locale-Insensitive
/// ==================
///
/// The fundamental operations on Swift strings are not sensitive to
/// locale settings.  That's because, for example, the validity of a
/// `Dictionary<String, T>` in a running program depends on a given
/// string comparison having a single, stable result.  Therefore,
/// Swift always uses the default,
/// un-[tailored](http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#tailorable) Unicode
/// algorithms for basic string operations.
///
/// Importing `Foundation` endows swift strings with the full power of
/// the `NSString` API, which allows you to choose more complex
/// locale-sensitive operations explicitly.
///
/// Value Semantics
/// ===============
///
/// Each string variable, `let` binding, or stored property has an
/// independent value, so mutations to the string are not observable
/// through its copies:
///
///     var a = "foo"
///     var b = a
///     b.append("bar")
///     print("a=\(a), b=\(b)")     // a=foo, b=foobar
///
/// Strings use Copy-on-Write so that their data is only copied
/// lazily, upon mutation, when more than one string instance is using
/// the same buffer.  Therefore, the first in any sequence of mutating
/// operations may cost `O(N)` time and space, where `N` is the length
/// of the string's (unspecified) underlying representation.
///
/// Views
/// =====
///
/// `String` is not itself a collection of anything.  Instead, it has
/// properties that present the string's contents as meaningful
/// collections:
///
///   - `characters`: a collection of `Character` ([extended grapheme
///     cluster](http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#extended_grapheme_cluster))
///     elements, a unit of text that is meaningful to most humans.
///
///   - `unicodeScalars`: a collection of `UnicodeScalar` ([Unicode
///     scalar
///     values](http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value))
///     the 21-bit codes that are the basic unit of Unicode.  These
///     values are equivalent to UTF-32 code units.
///
///   - `utf16`: a collection of `UTF16.CodeUnit`, the 16-bit
///     elements of the string's UTF-16 encoding.
///
///   - `utf8`: a collection of `UTF8.CodeUnit`, the 8-bit
///     elements of the string's UTF-8 encoding.
///
/// Growth and Capacity
/// ===================
///
/// When a string's contiguous storage fills up, new storage must be
/// allocated and characters must be moved to the new storage.
/// `String` uses an exponential growth strategy that makes `append` a
/// constant time operation *when amortized over many invocations*.
///
/// Objective-C Bridge
/// ==================
///
/// `String` is bridged to Objective-C as `NSString`, and a `String`
/// that originated in Objective-C may store its characters in an
/// `NSString`.  Since any arbitrary subclass of `NSString` can
/// become a `String`, there are no guarantees about representation or
/// efficiency in this case.  Since `NSString` is immutable, it is
/// just as though the storage was shared by some copy: the first in
/// any sequence of mutating operations causes elements to be copied
/// into unique, contiguous storage which may cost `O(N)` time and
