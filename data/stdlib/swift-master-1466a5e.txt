/// ===========================================
///
/// Objects with a concrete type of `AnyObject` maintain a specific dynamic
/// type and can be cast to that type using one of the type-cast operators
/// (`as`, `as?`, or `as!`).
///
/// This example uses the conditional downcast operator (`as?`) to

///         print("Successful cast to String: \(message)")

///     print("Successful cast to String: \(message)")
///     // Prints "Successful cast to String: This is a bridged string."
///
///     let badCase = v as! String
///     // Runtime error
///
/// Casting is always safe in the context of a `switch` statement.

///
/// Accessing Objective-C Methods and Properties
/// ============================================
///
/// When you use `AnyObject` as a concrete type, you have at your disposal
/// every `@objc` method and property---that is, methods and properties
/// imported from Objective-C or marked with the `@objc` attribute. Because
/// Swift can't guarantee at compile time that these methods and properties
/// are actually available on an `AnyObject` instance's underlying type, these
/// `@objc` symbols are available as implicitly unwrapped optional methods and
/// properties, respectively.
///
/// This example defines an `IntegerRef` type with an `@objc` method named
/// `getIntegerValue()`.
///
///     class IntegerRef {
///         let value: Int
///         init(_ value: Int) {
///             self.value = value
///         }

///         }
///     }
///
///     func getObject() -> AnyObject {
///         return IntegerRef(100)
///     }
///
///     let obj: AnyObject = getObject()
///
/// In the example, `obj` has a static type of `AnyObject` and a dynamic type
/// of `IntegerRef`. You can use optional chaining to call the `@objc` method
/// `getIntegerValue()` on `obj` safely. If you're sure of the dynamic type of
/// `obj`, you can call `getIntegerValue()` directly.
///
///     let possibleValue = obj.getIntegerValue?()

/// Without any other information, Swift creates an array that includes the
/// specified values, automatically inferring the array's `Element` type. For

///
///     // An array of 'Int' elements
///     let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
///
///     // An array of 'String' elements
///     let streets = ["Albemarle", "Brandywine", "Chesapeake"]
///
/// You can create an empty array by specifying the `Element` type of your
/// array in the declaration. For example:
///
///     // Shortened forms are preferred
///     var emptyDoubles: [Double] = []
///
///     // The full type name is also allowed
///     var emptyFloats: Array<Float> = Array()
///
/// If you need an array that is preinitialized with a fixed number of default
/// values, use the `Array(repeating:count:)` initializer.
///
///     var digitCounts = Array(repeating: 0, count: 10)
///     print(digitCounts)
///     // Prints "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
///
/// Accessing Array Values
/// ======================
///
/// When you need to perform an operation on all of an array's elements, use a
/// `for`-`in` loop to iterate through the array's contents.
///
///     for street in streets {
///         print("I don't live on \(street).")
///     }
///     // Prints "I don't live on Albemarle."
///     // Prints "I don't live on Brandywine."
///     // Prints "I don't live on Chesapeake."
///
/// Use the `isEmpty` property to check quickly whether an array has any
/// elements, or use the `count` property to find the number of elements in
/// the array.
///
///     if oddNumbers.isEmpty {
///         print("I don't know any odd numbers.")
///     } else {
///         print("I know \(oddNumbers.count) odd numbers.")
///     }
///     // Prints "I know 8 odd numbers."
///
/// Use the `first` and `last` properties for safe access to the value of the
/// array's first and last elements. If the array is empty, these properties
/// are `nil`.
///
///     if let firstElement = oddNumbers.first, let lastElement = oddNumbers.last {
///         print(firstElement, lastElement, separator: ", ")
///     }
///     // Prints "1, 15"
///
///     print(emptyDoubles.first, emptyDoubles.last, separator: ", ")
///     // Prints "nil, nil"
///
/// You can access individual array elements through a subscript. The first

///
///     print(oddNumbers[0], oddNumbers[3], separator: ", ")
///     // Prints "1, 7"
///
///     print(emptyDoubles[0])
///     // Triggers runtime error: Index out of range
///
/// Adding and Removing Elements
/// ============================
///
/// Suppose you need to store a list of the names of students that are signed
/// up for a class you're teaching. During the registration period, you need
/// to add and remove names as students add and drop the class.
///
///     var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell"]
///
/// To add single elements to the end of an array, use the `append(_:)` method.

///
///     students.append("Maxime")
///     students.append(contentsOf: ["Shakia", "William"])
///     // ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Maxime", "Shakia", "William"]
///
/// You can add new elements in the middle of an array by using the
/// `insert(_:at:)` method for single elements and by using
/// `insert(contentsOf:at:)` to insert multiple elements from another
/// collection or array literal. The elements at that index and later indices
/// are shifted back to make room.
///
///     students.insert("Liam", at: 3)
///     // ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Maxime", "Shakia", "William"]
///
/// To remove elements from an array, use the `remove(at:)`,

///
///     // William is signing up for a different class
///     students.removeLast()
///     // ["Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Maxime", "Shakia"]
///
/// You can replace an existing element with a new value by assigning the new

///
///     if let i = students.index(of: "Maxime") {
///         students[i] = "Max"
///     }
///     // ["Ivy", "Jordell", "Liam", "Max", "Shakia"]
///
/// Growing the Size of an Array
/// ----------------------------
///
/// Every array reserves a specific amount of memory to hold its contents. When
/// you add elements to an array and that array begins to exceed its reserved
/// capacity, the array allocates a larger region of memory and copies its
/// elements into the new storage. The new storage is a multiple of the old
/// storage's size. This exponential growth strategy means that appending an
/// element happens in constant time, averaging the performance of many append
/// operations. Append operations that trigger reallocation have a performance
/// cost, but they occur less and less often as the array grows larger.
///
/// If you know approximately how many elements you will need to store, use the
/// `reserveCapacity(_:)` method before appending to the array to avoid
/// intermediate reallocations. Use the `capacity` and `count` properties to
/// determine how many more elements the array can store without allocating
/// larger storage.
///
/// For arrays of most `Element` types, this storage is a contiguous block of
/// memory. For arrays with an `Element` type that is a class or `@objc`
/// protocol type, this storage can be a contiguous block of memory or an
/// instance of `NSArray`. Because any arbitrary subclass of `NSArray` can
/// become an `Array`, there are no guarantees about representation or
/// efficiency in this case.
///
/// Modifying Copies of Arrays
/// ==========================
///
/// Each array has an independent value that includes the values of all of its
/// elements. For simple types such as integers and other structures, this
/// means that when you change a value in one array, the value of that element
/// does not change in any copies of the array. For example:
///
///     var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///     var numbersCopy = numbers
///     numbers[0] = 100
///     print(numbers)
///     // Prints "[100, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
///     print(numbersCopy)
///     // Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
///
/// If the elements in an array are instances of a class, the semantics are the
/// same, though they might appear different at first. In this case, the
/// values stored in the array are references to objects that live outside the
/// array. If you change a reference to an object in one array, only that
/// array has a reference to the new object. However, if two arrays contain
/// references to the same object, you can observe changes to that object's
/// properties from both arrays. For example:
///
///     // An integer type with reference semantics
///     class IntegerReference {
///         var value = 10
///     }
///     var firstIntegers = [IntegerReference(), IntegerReference()]
///     var secondIntegers = firstIntegers
///
///     // Modifications to an instance are visible from either array
///     firstIntegers[0].value = 100
///     print(secondIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "100"
///
///     // Replacements, additions, and removals are still visible
///     // only in the modified array
///     firstIntegers[0] = IntegerReference()
///     print(firstIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "10"
///     print(secondIntegers[0].value)
///     // Prints "100"
///
/// Arrays, like all variable-size collections in the standard library, use
/// copy-on-write optimization. Multiple copies of an array share the same
/// storage until you modify one of the copies. When that happens, the array
/// being modified replaces its storage with a uniquely owned copy of itself,
/// which is then modified in place. Optimizations are sometimes applied that
/// can reduce the amount of copying.
///
/// This means that if an array is sharing storage with other copies, the first
/// mutating operation on that array incurs the cost of copying the array. An
/// array that is the sole owner of its storage can perform mutating
/// operations in place.
///
/// In the example below, a `numbers` array is created along with two copies
/// that share the same storage. When the original `numbers` array is
/// modified, it makes a unique copy of its storage before making the
/// modification. Further modifications to `numbers` are made in place, while
/// the two copies continue to share the original storage.
///
///     var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///     var firstCopy = numbers
///     var secondCopy = numbers
///
///     // The storage for 'numbers' is copied here
///     numbers[0] = 100
///     numbers[1] = 200
///     numbers[2] = 300
///     // 'numbers' is [100, 200, 300, 4, 5]
///     // 'firstCopy' and 'secondCopy' are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
///
/// Bridging Between Array and NSArray
/// ==================================
///
/// When you need to access APIs that require data in an `NSArray` instance
/// instead of `Array`, use the type-cast operator (`as`) to bridge your
/// instance. For bridging to be possible, the `Element` type of your array
/// must be a class, an `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C
/// or marked with the `@objc` attribute), or a type that bridges to a
/// Foundation type.

///
/// The `ArraySlice` type makes it fast and efficient for you to perform
/// operations on sections of a larger array. Instead of copying over the
/// elements of a slice to new storage, an `ArraySlice` instance presents a
/// view onto the storage of a larger array. And because `ArraySlice`
/// presents the same interface as `Array`, you can generally perform the
/// same operations on a slice as you could on the original array.
///
/// For more information about using arrays, see `Array` and `ContiguousArray`,
/// with which `ArraySlice` shares most properties and methods.
///
/// Slices Are Views onto Arrays
/// ============================
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences
/// from each class during a session.
///
///     let absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You want to compare the absences in the first half of the session with
/// those in the second half. To do so, start by creating two slices of the
/// `absences` array.
///
///     let midpoint = absences.count / 2
///
///     let firstHalf = absences.prefix(upTo: midpoint)
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(from: midpoint)
///
/// Neither the `firstHalf` nor `secondHalf` slices allocate any new storage
/// of their own. Instead, each presents a view onto the storage of the
/// `absences` array.
///
/// You can call any method on the slices that you might have called on the
/// `absences` array. To learn which half had more absences, use the
/// `reduce(_:_:)` method to calculate each sum.
///
///     let firstHalfSum = firstHalf.reduce(0, +)
///     let secondHalfSum = secondHalf.reduce(0, +)
///
///     if firstHalfSum > secondHalfSum {
///         print("More absences in the first half.")
///     } else {
///         print("More absences in the second half.")
///     }
///     // Prints "More absences in the second half."
///
/// - Important: Long-term storage of `ArraySlice` instances is discouraged. A
///   slice holds a reference to the entire storage of a larger array, not
///   just to the portion it presents, even after the original array's lifetime
///   ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore prolong the lifetime of
///   elements that are no longer otherwise accessible, which can appear to be
///   memory and object leakage.
///
/// Slices Maintain Indices
/// =======================
///
/// Unlike `Array` and `ContiguousArray`, the starting index for an
/// `ArraySlice` instance isn't always zero. Slices maintain the same
/// indices of the larger array for the same elements, so the starting
/// index of a slice depends on how it was created, letting you perform
/// index-based operations on either a full array or a slice.
///
/// Sharing indices between collections and their subsequences is an important
/// part of the design of Swift's collection algorithms. Suppose you are
/// tasked with finding the first two days with absences in the session. To
/// find the indices of the two days in question, follow these steps:
///
/// 1) Call `index(where:)` to find the index of the first element in the
///    `absences` array that is greater than zero.
/// 2) Create a slice of the `absences` array starting after the index found in
///    step 1.
/// 3) Call `index(where:)` again, this time on the slice created in step 2.
///    Where in some languages you might pass a starting index into an
///    `indexOf` method to find the second day, in Swift you perform the same
///    operation on a slice of the original array.
/// 4) Print the results using the indices found in steps 1 and 3 on the
///    original `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     if let i = absences.index(where: { $0 > 0 }) {                      // 1
///         let absencesAfterFirst = absences.suffix(from: i + 1)           // 2
///         if let j = absencesAfterFirst.index(where: { $0 > 0 }) {        // 3
///             print("The first day with absences had \(absences[i]).")    // 4
///             print("The second day with absences had \(absences[j]).")
///         }
///     }
///     // Prints "The first day with absences had 2."
///     // Prints "The second day with absences had 4."
///
/// In particular, note that `j`, the index of the second day with absences,
/// was found in a slice of the original array and then used to access a value
/// in the original `absences` array itself.
///
/// - Note: To safely reference the starting and ending indices of a slice,
///   always use the `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties instead of
///   specific values.

///
/// Slices Share Indices
/// --------------------
///
/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base
/// collection. An element of a slice is located under the same index in the
/// slice and in the base collection, as long as neither the collection nor
/// the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from
/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `BidirectionalSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise

///         let x: UInt8 = 5        // 0b00000101

///         print(x ^ .allZeros)    // 0b00000101
///         // Prints "5"
///
/// - The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) is a prefix operator that returns a value
///   where all the bits of its argument are flipped: Bits that are `1` in the

/// Collections are used extensively throughout the standard library. When you

/// you benefit from the operations that the `Collection` protocol declares
/// and implements.
///
/// In addition to the methods that collections inherit from the `Sequence`
/// protocol, you gain access to methods that depend on accessing an element
/// at a specific position when using a collection.
///
/// For example, if you want to print only the first word in a string, search
/// for the index of the first space and then create a subsequence up to that
/// position.
///
///     let text = "Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo."
///     if let firstSpace = text.characters.index(of: " ") {
///         print(String(text.characters.prefix(upTo: firstSpace)))
///     }
///     // Prints "Buffalo"
///
/// The `firstSpace` constant is an index into the `text.characters`
/// collection. `firstSpace` is the position of the first space in the
/// collection. You can store indices in variables, and pass them to
/// collection algorithms or use them later to access the corresponding
/// element. In the example above, `firstSpace` is used to extract the prefix
/// that contains elements up to that index.
///
/// You can pass only valid indices to collection operations. You can find a
/// complete set of a collection's valid indices by starting with the
/// collection's `startIndex` property and finding every successor up to, and
/// including, the `endIndex` property. All other values of the `Index` type,
/// such as the `startIndex` property of a different collection, are invalid
/// indices for this collection.
///
/// Saved indices may become invalid as a result of mutating operations; for
/// more information about index invalidation in mutable collections, see the
/// reference for the `MutableCollection` and `RangeReplaceableCollection`
/// protocols, as well as for the specific type you're using.
///
/// Accessing Individual Elements
/// =============================
///
/// You can access an element of a collection through its subscript with any
/// valid index except the collection's `endIndex` property, a "past the end"
/// index that does not correspond with any element of the collection.
///
/// Here's an example of accessing the first character in a string through its
/// subscript:
///
///     let firstChar = text.characters[text.characters.startIndex]
///     print(firstChar)
///     // Prints "B"
///
/// The `Collection` protocol declares and provides default implementations for
/// many operations that depend on elements being accessible by their
/// subscript. For example, you can also access the first character of `text`
/// using the `first` property, which has the value of the first element of
/// the collection, or `nil` if the collection is empty.
///
///     print(text.characters.first)
///     // Prints "Optional("B")"
///
/// Traversing a Collection
/// =======================
///
/// Although a sequence can be consumed as it is traversed, a collection is
/// guaranteed to be multipass: Any element may be repeatedly accessed by
/// saving its index. Moreover, a collection's indices form a finite range of
/// the positions of the collection's elements. This guarantees the safety of
/// operations that depend on a sequence being finite, such as checking to see
/// whether a collection contains an element.
///
/// Iterating over the elements of a collection by their positions yields the
/// same elements in the same order as iterating over that collection using
/// its iterator. This example demonstrates that the `characters` view of a
/// string returns the same characters in the same order whether the view's
/// indices or the view itself is being iterated.
///
///     let word = "Swift"
///     for character in word.characters {
///         print(character)
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
///
///     for i in word.characters.indices {
///         print(word.characters[i])
///     }
///     // Prints "S"
///     // Prints "w"
///     // Prints "i"
///     // Prints "f"
///     // Prints "t"
///
/// Conforming to the Collection Protocol
/// =====================================
///
/// If you create a custom sequence that can provide repeated access to its
/// elements, make sure that its type conforms to the `Collection` protocol in
/// order to give a more useful and more efficient interface for sequence and
/// collection operations. To add `Collection` conformance to your type, you
/// must declare at least the four following requirements:
///
/// - the `startIndex` and `endIndex` properties,
/// - a subscript that provides at least read-only access to your type's
///   elements, and
/// - the `index(after:)` method for advancing an index into your collection.
///
/// Expected Performance
/// ====================
///
/// Types that conform to `Collection` are expected to provide the `startIndex`
/// and `endIndex` properties and subscript access to elements as O(1)
/// operations. Types that are not able to guarantee that expected performance
/// must document the departure, because many collection operations depend on
/// O(1) subscripting performance for their own performance guarantees.
///
/// The performance of some collection operations depends on the type of index
/// that the collection provides. For example, a random-access collection,
/// which can measure the distance between two indices in O(1) time, will be
/// able to calculate its `count` property in O(1) time. Conversely, because a
/// forward or bidirectional collection must traverse the entire collection to
/// count the number of contained elements, accessing its `count` property is
/// an O(*n*) operation.

///     let currentTemp = 73
///
///     if currentTemp >= 90 {
///         print("It's a scorcher!")

///         print("Seems like picnic weather!")

/// using arguments to sort the elements of your array in ascending order.
///
///     var measurements = [1.1, 1.5, 2.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.3, 1.2]
///     measurements.sort()
///     print(measurements)
///     // Prints "[1.1, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.5, 2.9]"
///
/// Conforming to the Comparable Protocol
/// =====================================
///
/// Types with Comparable conformance implement the less-than operator (`<`)
/// and the equal-to operator (`==`). These two operations impose a strict
/// total order on the values of a type, in which exactly one of the following
/// must be true for any two values `a` and `b`:
///
/// - `a == b`
/// - `a < b`
/// - `b < a`
///
/// In addition, the following conditions must hold:
///
/// - `a < a` is always `false` (Irreflexivity)
/// - `a < b` implies `!(b < a)` (Asymmetry)
/// - `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c` (Transitivity)
///
/// To add `Comparable` conformance to your custom types, define the `<` and
/// `==` operators as static methods of your types. The `==` operator is a
/// requirement of the `Equatable` protocol, which `Comparable` extends---see
/// that protocol's documentation for more information about equality in
/// Swift. Because default implementations of the remainder of the relational
/// operators are provided by the standard library, you'll be able to use
/// `!=`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` with instances of your type without any further
/// code.
///
/// As an example, here's an implementation of a `Date` structure that stores
/// the year, month, and day of a date:
///
///     struct Date {
///         let year: Int
///         let month: Int
///         let day: Int
///     }
///
/// To add `Comparable` conformance to `Date`, first declare conformance to
/// `Comparable` and implement the `<` operator function.
///
///     extension Date: Comparable {
///         static func < (lhs: Date, rhs: Date) -> Bool {
///             if lhs.year != rhs.year {
///                 return lhs.year < rhs.year
///             } else if lhs.month != rhs.month {
///                 return lhs.month < rhs.month
///             } else {
///                 return lhs.day < rhs.day
///             }
///         }
///
/// This function uses the least specific nonmatching property of the date to
/// determine the result of the comparison. For example, if the two `year`
/// properties are equal but the two `month` properties are not, the date with
/// the lesser value for `month` is the lesser of the two dates.
///
/// Next, implement the `==` operator function, the requirement inherited from
/// the `Equatable` protocol.
///
///         static func == (lhs: Date, rhs: Date) -> Bool {
///             return lhs.year == rhs.year && lhs.month == rhs.month
///                 && lhs.day == rhs.day
///         }
///     }
///
/// Two `Date` instances are equal if each of their corresponding properties is
/// equal.
///
/// Now that `Date` conforms to `Comparable`, you can compare instances of the
/// type with any of the relational operators. The following example compares
/// the date of the first moon landing with the release of David Bowie's song
/// "Space Oddity":
///
///     let spaceOddity = Date(year: 1969, month: 7, day: 11)   // July 11, 1969
///     let moonLanding = Date(year: 1969, month: 7, day: 20)   // July 20, 1969
///     if moonLanding > spaceOddity {
///         print("Major Tom stepped through the door first.")
///     } else {
///         print("David Bowie was following in Neil Armstrong's footsteps.")
///     }
///     // Prints "Major Tom stepped through the door first."
///
/// Note that the `>` operator provided by the standard library is used in this
/// example, not the `<` operator implemented above.
///
/// - Note: A conforming type may contain a subset of values which are treated
///   as exceptional---that is, values that are outside the domain of
///   meaningful arguments for the purposes of the `Comparable` protocol. For
///   example, the special "not a number" value for floating-point types

    /// (padded to a round value), and no more. This avoids over-allocation, but
    /// can result in insertion not having amortized constant-time performance.
    ///
    /// The following code declares `values`, an array of integers, and the
    /// `addTenQuadratic()` function, which adds ten more values to the `values`
    /// array on each call.

///
/// Create a new dictionary by using a dictionary literal. A dictionary literal

/// assign a dictionary literal to a variable or constant or pass it to a
/// function that expects a dictionary.
///
/// Here's how you would create a dictionary of HTTP response codes and their

///
///     var responseMessages = [200: "OK",
///                             403: "Access forbidden",
///                             404: "File not found",

/// The `Key` type of the dictionary is `Int`, and the `Value` type of the
/// dictionary is `String`.
///
/// To create a dictionary with no key-value pairs, use an empty dictionary
/// literal (`[:]`).
///
///     var emptyDict: [String: String] = [:]
///
/// Any type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol can be used as a
/// dictionary's `Key` type, including all of Swift's basic types. You can use
/// your own custom types as dictionary keys by making them conform to the
/// `Hashable` protocol.
///
/// Getting and Setting Dictionary Values
/// =====================================
///
/// The most common way to access values in a dictionary is to use a key as a
/// subscript. Subscripting with a key takes the following form:
///
///     print(responseMessages[200])
///     // Prints "Optional("OK")"
///
/// Subscripting a dictionary with a key returns an optional value, because a
/// dictionary might not hold a value for the key that you use in the
/// subscript.
///
/// The next example uses key-based subscripting of the `responseMessages`
/// dictionary with two keys that exist in the dictionary and one that does
/// not.
///
///     let httpResponseCodes = [200, 403, 301]
///     for code in httpResponseCodes {
///         if let message = responseMessages[code] {
///             print("Response \(code): \(message)")
///         } else {
///             print("Unknown response \(code)")
///         }
///     }
///     // Prints "Response 200: OK"
///     // Prints "Response 403: Access Forbidden"
///     // Prints "Unknown response 301"
///
/// You can also update, modify, or remove keys and values from a dictionary
/// using the key-based subscript. To add a new key-value pair, assign a value
/// to a key that isn't yet a part of the dictionary.
///
///     responseMessages[301] = "Moved permanently"
///     print(responseMessages[301])
///     // Prints "Optional("Moved permanently")"
///
/// Update an existing value by assigning a new value to a key that already
/// exists in the dictionary. If you assign `nil` to an existing key, the key
/// and its associated value are removed. The following example updates the
/// value for the `404` code to be simply "Not found" and removes the
/// key-value pair for the `500` code entirely.
///
///     responseMessages[404] = "Not found"
///     responseMessages[500] = nil
///     print(responseMessages)
///     // Prints "[301: "Moved permanently", 200: "OK", 403: "Access forbidden", 404: "Not found"]"
///
/// In a mutable `Dictionary` instance, you can modify in place a value that
/// you've accessed through a keyed subscript. The code sample below declares a
/// dictionary called `interestingNumbers` with string keys and values that
/// are integer arrays, then sorts each array in-place in descending order.
///
///     var interestingNumbers = ["primes": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15],
///                               "triangular": [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28],
///                               "hexagonal": [1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91]]
///     for key in interestingNumbers.keys {
///         interestingNumbers[key]?.sort(by: >)
///     }
///
///     print(interestingNumbers["primes"]!)
///     // Prints "[15, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]"
///
/// Iterating Over the Contents of a Dictionary
/// ===========================================
///
/// Every dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You can
/// iterate over a dictionary using a `for`-`in` loop, decomposing each
/// key-value pair into the elements of a tuple.
///
///     let imagePaths = ["star": "/glyphs/star.png",
///                       "portrait": "/images/content/portrait.jpg",
///                       "spacer": "/images/shared/spacer.gif"]
///
///     for (name, path) in imagePaths {
///         print("The path to '\(name)' is '\(path)'.")
///     }
///     // Prints "The path to 'star' is '/glyphs/star.png'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'portrait' is '/images/content/portrait.jpg'."
///     // Prints "The path to 'spacer' is '/images/shared/spacer.gif'."
///
/// The order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is stable between mutations
/// but is otherwise unpredictable. If you need an ordered collection of
/// key-value pairs and don't need the fast key lookup that `Dictionary`
/// provides, see the `DictionaryLiteral` type for an alternative.
///
/// You can search a dictionary's contents for a particular value using the
/// `contains(where:)` or `index(where:)` methods supplied by default
/// implementation. The following example checks to see if `imagePaths` contains
/// any paths in the `"/glyphs"` directory:
///
///     let glyphIndex = imagePaths.index { $0.value.hasPrefix("/glyphs") }
///     if let index = glyphIndex {
///         print("The '\(imagesPaths[index].key)' image is a glyph.")
///     } else {
///         print("No glyphs found!")
///     }
///     // Prints "The 'star' image is a glyph.")
///
/// Note that in this example, `imagePaths` is subscripted using a dictionary
/// index. Unlike the key-based subscript, the index-based subscript returns
/// the corresponding key-value pair as a non-optional tuple.
///
///     print(imagePaths[glyphIndex!])
///     // Prints "("star", "/glyphs/star.png")"
///
/// A dictionary's indices stay valid across additions to the dictionary as
/// long as the dictionary has enough capacity to store the added values
/// without allocating more buffer. When a dictionary outgrows its buffer,
/// existing indices may be invalidated without any notification.
///
/// When you know how many new values you're adding to a dictionary, use the
/// `init(minimumCapacity:)` initializer to allocate the correct amount of
/// buffer.
///
/// Bridging Between Dictionary and NSDictionary
/// ============================================
///
/// You can bridge between `Dictionary` and `NSDictionary` using the `as`
/// operator. For bridging to be possible, the `Key` and `Value` types of a
/// dictionary must be classes, `@objc` protocols, or types that bridge to
/// Foundation types.
///
/// Bridging from `Dictionary` to `NSDictionary` always takes O(1) time and
/// space. When the dictionary's `Key` and `Value` types are neither classes
/// nor `@objc` protocols, any required bridging of elements occurs at the
/// first access of each element. For this reason, the first operation that
/// uses the contents of the dictionary may take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary` first calls the `copy(with:)`
/// method (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the dictionary to get an
/// immutable copy and then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that
/// takes O(1) time. For instances of `NSDictionary` that are already
/// immutable, `copy(with:)` usually returns the same dictionary in O(1) time;
/// otherwise, the copying performance is unspecified. The instances of
/// `NSDictionary` and `Dictionary` share buffer using the same copy-on-write
/// optimization that is used when two instances of `Dictionary` share
/// buffer.

///
/// Conforming to the Equatable Protocol
/// ====================================
///
/// Adding `Equatable` conformance to your custom types means that you can use
/// more convenient APIs when searching for particular instances in a
/// collection. `Equatable` is also the base protocol for the `Hashable` and
/// `Comparable` protocols, which allow more uses of your custom type, such as
/// constructing sets or sorting the elements of a collection.
///
/// To adopt the `Equatable` protocol, implement the equal-to operator (`==`)
/// as a static method of your type. The standard library provides an
/// implementation for the not-equal-to operator (`!=`) for any `Equatable`
/// type, which calls the custom `==` function and negates its result.
///
/// As an example, consider a `StreetAddress` structure that holds the parts of
/// a street address: a house or building number, the street name, and an
/// optional unit number. Here's the initial declaration of the
/// `StreetAddress` type:
///
///     struct StreetAddress {
///         let number: String
///         let street: String
///         let unit: String?
///
///         init(_ number: String, _ street: String, unit: String? = nil) {
///             self.number = number
///             self.street = street
///             self.unit = unit
///         }
///     }
///
/// Now suppose you have an array of addresses that you need to check for a
/// particular address. To use the `contains(_:)` method without including a
/// closure in each call, extend the `StreetAddress` type to conform to
/// `Equatable`.
///
///     extension StreetAddress: Equatable {
///         static func == (lhs: StreetAddress, rhs: StreetAddress) -> Bool {
///             return
///                 lhs.number == rhs.number &&
///                 lhs.street == rhs.street &&
///                 lhs.unit == rhs.unit
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `StreetAddress` type now conforms to `Equatable`. You can use `==` to
/// check for equality between any two instances or call the
/// `Equatable`-constrained `contains(_:)` method.
///
///     let addresses = [StreetAddress("1490", "Grove Street"),
///                      StreetAddress("2119", "Maple Avenue"),
///                      StreetAddress("1400", "16th Street")]
///     let home = StreetAddress("1400", "16th Street")
///
///     print(addresses[0] == home)
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(addresses.contains(home))
///     // Prints "true"
///
/// Equality implies substitutability---any two instances that compare equally
/// can be used interchangeably in any code that depends on their values. To
/// maintain substitutability, the `==` operator should take into account all
/// visible aspects of an `Equatable` type. Exposing nonvalue aspects of
/// `Equatable` types other than class identity is discouraged, and any that
/// *are* exposed should be explicitly pointed out in documentation.
///
/// Since equality between instances of `Equatable` types is an equivalence
/// relation, any of your custom types that conform to `Equatable` must
/// satisfy three conditions, for any values `a`, `b`, and `c`:
///
/// - `a == a` is always `true` (Reflexivity)
/// - `a == b` implies `b == a` (Symmetry)
/// - `a == b` and `b == c` implies `a == c` (Transitivity)
///
/// Moreover, inequality is the inverse of equality, so any custom
/// implementation of the `!=` operator must guarantee that `a != b` implies
/// `!(a == b)`. The default implementation of the `!=` operator function
/// satisfies this requirement.
///
/// Equality is Separate From Identity
/// ----------------------------------
///
/// The identity of a class instance is not part of an instance's value.
/// Consider a class called `IntegerRef` that wraps an integer value. Here's
/// the definition for `IntegerRef` and the `==` function that makes it
/// conform to `Equatable`:
///
///     class IntegerRef: Equatable {
///         let value: Int
///         init(_ value: Int) {
///             self.value = value
///         }
///
///         static func == (lhs: IntegerRef, rhs: IntegerRef) -> Bool {
///             return lhs.value == rhs.value
///         }
///     }
///
/// The implementation of the `==` function returns the same value whether its
/// two arguments are the same instance or are two different instances with
/// the same integer stored in their `value` properties. For example:
///
///     let a = IntegerRef(100)
///     let b = IntegerRef(100)
///
///     print(a == a, a == b, separator: ", ")
///     // Prints "true, true"
///
/// Class instance identity, on the other hand, is compared using the
/// triple-equals identical-to operator (`===`). For example:
///
///     let c = a
///     print(a === c, b === c, separator: ", ")
///     // Prints "true, false"
public protocol Equatable {

    /// Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

/// Any type that declares conformance to the `Error` protocol can be used to

/// protocol has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on
/// any custom type you create.
///
/// Using Enumerations as Errors
/// ============================
///
/// Swift's enumerations are well suited to represent simple errors. Create an
/// enumeration that conforms to the `Error` protocol with a case for each
/// possible error. If there are additional details about the error that could
/// be helpful for recovery, use associated values to include that
/// information.
///
/// The following example shows an `IntParsingError` enumeration that captures
/// two different kinds of errors that can occur when parsing an integer from
/// a string: overflow, where the value represented by the string is too large
/// for the integer data type, and invalid input, where nonnumeric characters
/// are found within the input.
///
///     enum IntParsingError: Error {
///         case overflow
///         case invalidInput(String)
///     }
///
/// The `invalidInput` case includes the invalid character as an associated
/// value.
///
/// The next code sample shows a possible extension to the `Int` type that
/// parses the integer value of a `String` instance, throwing an error when
/// there is a problem during parsing.
///
///     extension Int {
///         init(validating input: String) throws {
///             // ...
///             if !_isValid(s) {
///                 throw IntParsingError.invalidInput(s)
///             }
///             // ...
///         }
///     }
///
/// When calling the new `Int` initializer within a `do` statement, you can use
/// pattern matching to match specific cases of your custom error type and
/// access their associated values, as in the example below.
///
///     do {
///         let price = try Int(validating: "$100")
///     } catch IntParsingError.invalidInput(let invalid) {
///         print("Invalid character: '\(invalid)'")
///     } catch IntParsingError.overflow {
///         print("Overflow error")
///     } catch {
///         print("Other error")
///     }
///     // Prints "Invalid character: '$'"
///
/// Including More Data in Errors
/// =============================
///
/// Sometimes you may want different error states to include the same common
/// data, such as the position in a file or some of your application's state.
/// When you do, use a structure to represent errors. The following example
/// uses a structure to represent an error when parsing an XML document,
/// including the line and column numbers where the error occurred:
///
///     struct XMLParsingError: Error {
///         enum ErrorKind {
///             case invalidCharacter
///             case mismatchedTag
///             case internalError
///         }
///
///         let line: Int
///         let column: Int
///         let kind: ErrorKind
///     }
///
///     func parse(_ source: String) throws -> XMLDoc {
///         // ...
///         throw XMLParsingError(line: 19, column: 5, kind: .mismatchedTag)
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// Once again, use pattern matching to conditionally catch errors. Here's how
/// you can catch any `XMLParsingError` errors thrown by the `parse(_:)`
/// function:
///
///     do {
///         let xmlDoc = try parse(myXMLData)
///     } catch let e as XMLParsingError {
///         print("Parsing error: \(e.kind) [\(e.line):\(e.column)]")
///     } catch {
///         print("Other error: \(error)")
///     }
///     // Prints "Parsing error: mismatchedTag [19:5]"

/// A type that can be initialized using an array literal.
///
/// An array literal is a simple way of expressing a list of values. Simply
/// surround a comma-separated list of values, instances, or literals with
/// square brackets to create an array literal. You can use an array literal
/// anywhere an instance of an `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` type is expected: as
/// a value assigned to a variable or constant, as a parameter to a method or
/// initializer, or even as the subject of a nonmutating operation like
/// `map(_:)` or `filter(_:)`.
///
/// Arrays, sets, and option sets all conform to `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral`, 
/// and your own custom types can as well. Here's an example of creating a set 
/// and an array using array literals:
///
///     let employeesSet: Set<String> = ["Amir", "Jihye", "Dave", "Alessia", "Dave"]
///     print(employeesSet)
///     // Prints "["Amir", "Dave", "Jihye", "Alessia"]"
///
///     let employeesArray: [String] = ["Amir", "Jihye", "Dave", "Alessia", "Dave"]
///     print(employeesArray)
///     // Prints "["Amir", "Jihye", "Dave", "Alessia", "Dave"]"
///
/// The `Set` and `Array` types each handle array literals in their own way to
/// create new instances. In this case, the newly created set drops the
/// duplicate value ("Dave") and doesn't maintain the order of the array
/// literal's elements. The new array, on the other hand, matches the order
/// and number of elements provided.
///
/// - Note: An array literal is not the same as an `Array` instance. You can't
///   initialize a type that conforms to `ExpressibleByArrayLiteral` simply by
///   assigning an existing array.
///
///         let anotherSet: Set = employeesArray
///         // error: cannot convert value of type '[String]' to specified type 'Set'
///
/// Type Inference of Array Literals
/// ================================
///
/// Whenever possible, Swift's compiler infers the full intended type of your
/// array literal. Because `Array` is the default type for an array literal,
/// without writing any other code, you can declare an array with a particular
/// element type by providing one or more values.
///
/// In this example, the compiler infers the full type of each array literal.
///
///     let integers = [1, 2, 3]
///     // 'integers' has type '[Int]'
///
///     let strings = ["a", "b", "c"]
///     // 'strings' has type '[String]'
///
/// An empty array literal alone doesn't provide enough information for the
/// compiler to infer the intended type of the `Array` instance. When using an
/// empty array literal, specify the type of the variable or constant.
///
///     var emptyArray: [Bool] = []
///     // 'emptyArray' has type '[Bool]'
///
/// Because many functions and initializers fully specify the types of their
/// parameters, you can often use an array literal with or without elements as
/// a parameter. For example, the `sum(_:)` function shown here takes an `Int`
/// array as a parameter:
///
///     func sum(values: [Int]) -> Int {
///         return values.reduce(0, +)
///     }
///
///     let sumOfFour = sum([5, 10, 15, 20])
///     // 'sumOfFour' == 50
///
///     let sumOfNone = sum([])
///     // 'sumOfNone' == 0
///
/// When you call a function that does not fully specify its parameters' types,
/// use the type-cast operator (`as`) to specify the type of an array literal.
/// For example, the `log(name:value:)` function shown here has an
/// unconstrained generic `value` parameter.
///
///     func log<T>(name name: String, value: T) {
///         print("\(name): \(value)")
///     }
///
///     log(name: "Four integers", value: [5, 10, 15, 20])
///     // Prints "Four integers: [5, 10, 15, 20]"

/// 1. The string literal is broken into pieces. Each segment of the string
///    literal before, between, and after any included expressions, along with
///    the individual expressions themselves, are passed to the
///    `init(stringInterpolationSegment:)` initializer.
/// 2. The results of those calls are passed to the
///    `init(stringInterpolation:)` initializer in the order in which they
///    appear in the string literal.
///
/// In other words, initializing the `message` constant in the example above
/// using string interpolation is equivalent to the following code:
///
///     let message = String(stringInterpolation:
///           String(stringInterpolationSegment: "One cookie: $"),
///           String(stringInterpolationSegment: price),

/// Additional Considerations
/// =========================
///
/// In addition to representing specific numbers, floating-point types also

/// calculation.
///
/// Infinity
/// --------
///
/// Any value whose magnitude is so great that it would round to a value
/// outside the range of representable numbers is rounded to *infinity*. For a
/// type `F`, positive and negative infinity are represented as `F.infinity`
/// and `-F.infinity`, respectively. Positive infinity compares greater than
/// every finite value and negative infinity, while negative infinity compares
/// less than every finite value and positive infinity. Infinite values with
/// the same sign are equal to each other.
///
///     let values: [Double] = [10.0, 25.0, -10.0, .infinity, -.infinity]
///     print(values.sorted())
///     // Prints "[-inf, -10.0, 10.0, 25.0, inf]"
///
/// Operations with infinite values follow real arithmetic as much as possible:
/// Adding or subtracting a finite value, or multiplying or dividing infinity
/// by a nonzero finite value, results in infinity.
///
/// NaN ("not a number")
/// --------------------
///
/// Floating-point types represent values that are neither finite numbers nor
/// infinity as NaN, an abbreviation for "not a number." Comparing a NaN with
/// any value, including another NaN, results in `false`.
///
///     let myNaN = Double.nan
///     print(myNaN > 0)
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(myNaN < 0)
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(myNaN == .nan)
///     // Prints "false"
///
/// Because testing whether one NaN is equal to another NaN results in `false`,
/// use the `isNaN` property to test whether a value is NaN.
///
///     print(myNaN.isNaN)
///     // Prints "true"
///
/// NaN propagates through many arithmetic operations. When you are operating
/// on many values, this behavior is valuable because operations on NaN simply
/// forward the value and don't cause runtime errors. The following example
/// shows how NaN values operate in different contexts.
///
/// Imagine you have a set of temperature data for which you need to report
/// some general statistics: the total number of observations, the number of
/// valid observations, and the average temperature. First, a set of
/// observations in Celsius is parsed from strings to `Double` values:
///
///     let temperatureData = ["21.5", "19.25", "27", "no data", "28.25", "no data", "23"]
///     let tempsCelsius = temperatureData.map { Double($0) ?? .nan }
///     // tempsCelsius == [21.5, 19.25, 27, nan, 28.25, nan, 23.0]
///
/// Note that some elements in the `temperatureData ` array are not valid
/// numbers. When these invalid strings are parsed by the `Double` failable
/// initializer, the example uses the nil-coalescing operator (`??`) to
/// provide NaN as a fallback value.
///
/// Next, the observations in Celsius are converted to Fahrenheit:
///
///     let tempsFahrenheit = tempsCelsius.map { $0 * 1.8 + 32 }
///     // tempsFahrenheit == [70.7, 66.65, 80.6, nan, 82.85, nan, 73.4]
///
/// The NaN values in the `tempsCelsius` array are propagated through the
/// conversion and remain NaN in `tempsFahrenheit`.
///
/// Because calculating the average of the observations involves combining
/// every value of the `tempsFahrenheit` array, any NaN values cause the
/// result to also be NaN, as seen in this example:
///
///     let badAverage = tempsFahrenheit.reduce(0.0, combine: +) / Double(tempsFahrenheit.count)
///     // badAverage.isNaN == true
///
/// Instead, when you need an operation to have a specific numeric result,
/// filter out any NaN values using the `isNaN` property.
///
///     let validTemps = tempsFahrenheit.filter { !$0.isNaN }
///     let average = validTemps.reduce(0.0, combine: +) / Double(validTemps.count)
///
/// Finally, report the average temperature and observation counts:
///
///     print("Average: \(average)°F in \(validTemps.count) " +
///           "out of \(tempsFahrenheit.count) observations.")
///     // Prints "Average: 74.84°F in 5 out of 7 observations."

/// You can use any type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol in a set or

/// `Hashable`: strings, integers, floating-point and Boolean values, and even
/// sets provide a hash value by default. Your own custom types can be
/// hashable as well. When you define an enumeration without associated
/// values, it gains `Hashable` conformance automatically, and you can add
/// `Hashable` conformance to your other custom types by adding a single
/// `hashValue` property.
///
/// A hash value, provided by a type's `hashValue` property, is an integer that
/// is the same for any two instances that compare equally. That is, for two
/// instances `a` and `b` of the same type, if `a == b` then
/// `a.hashValue == b.hashValue`. The reverse is not true: Two instances with
/// equal hash values are not necessarily equal to each other.
///
/// - Important: Hash values are not guaranteed to be equal across different
///   executions of your program. Do not save hash values to use during a
///   future execution.
///
/// Conforming to the Hashable Protocol
/// ===================================
///
/// To use your own custom type in a set or as the key type of a dictionary,
/// add `Hashable` conformance to your type by providing a `hashValue`
/// property. The `Hashable` protocol inherits from the `Equatable` protocol,
/// so you must also add an equal-to operator (`==`) function for your
/// custom type.
///
/// As an example, consider a `GridPoint` type that describes a location in a
/// grid of buttons. Here's the initial declaration of the `GridPoint` type:
///
///     /// A point in an x-y coordinate system.
///     struct GridPoint {
///         var x: Int
///         var y: Int
///     }
///
/// You'd like to create a set of the grid points where a user has already
/// tapped. Because the `GridPoint` type is not hashable yet, it can't be used
/// as the `Element` type for a set. To add `Hashable` conformance, provide an
/// `==` operator function and a `hashValue` property.
///
///     extension GridPoint: Hashable {
///         var hashValue: Int {
///             return x.hashValue ^ y.hashValue
///         }
///
///         static func == (lhs: GridPoint, rhs: GridPoint) -> Bool {
///             return lhs.x == rhs.x && lhs.y == rhs.y
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `hashValue` property in this example combines the hash values of a grid
/// point's `x` and `y` values using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`). The `^`
/// operator is one way to combine two integer values into a single value.
///
/// - Note: Set and dictionary performance depends on hash values that minimize
///   collisions for their associated element and key types, respectively.
///
/// Now that `GridPoint` conforms to the `Hashable` protocol, you can create a
/// set of previously tapped grid points.
///
///     var tappedPoints: Set = [GridPoint(x: 2, y: 3), GridPoint(x: 4, y: 1)]
///     let nextTap = GridPoint(x: 0, y: 1)
///     if tappedPoints.contains(nextTap) {

/// The `IteratorProtocol` protocol is tightly linked with the `Sequence`

/// element at a time as it advances through the sequence.
///
/// Whenever you use a `for`-`in` loop with an array, set, or any other
/// collection or sequence, you're using that type's iterator. Swift uses a
/// sequence's or collection's iterator internally to enable the `for`-`in`
/// loop language construct.
///
/// Using a sequence's iterator directly gives you access to the same elements
/// in the same order as iterating over that sequence using a `for`-`in` loop.
/// For example, you might typically use a `for`-`in` loop to print each of
/// the elements in an array.
///
///     let animals = ["Antelope", "Butterfly", "Camel", "Dolphin"]
///     for animal in animals {
///         print(animal)
///     }
///     // Prints "Antelope"
///     // Prints "Butterfly"
///     // Prints "Camel"
///     // Prints "Dolphin"
///
/// Behind the scenes, Swift uses the `animals` array's iterator to loop over
/// the contents of the array.
///
///     var animalIterator = animals.makeIterator()
///     while let animal = animalIterator.next() {
///         print(animal)
///     }
///     // Prints "Antelope"
///     // Prints "Butterfly"
///     // Prints "Camel"
///     // Prints "Dolphin"

/// The call to `animals.makeIterator()` returns an instance of the array's
/// iterator. Next, the `while` loop calls the iterator's `next()` method
/// repeatedly, binding each element that is returned to `animal` and exiting
/// when the `next()` method returns `nil`.
///
/// Using Iterators Directly
/// ========================
///
/// You rarely need to use iterators directly, because a `for`-`in` loop is the
/// more idiomatic approach to traversing a sequence in Swift. Some
/// algorithms, however, may call for direct iterator use.
///
/// One example is the `reduce1(_:)` method. Similar to the `reduce(_:_:)`
/// method defined in the standard library, which takes an initial value and a
/// combining closure, `reduce1(_:)` uses the first element of the sequence as
/// the initial value.
///
/// Here's an implementation of the `reduce1(_:)` method. The sequence's
/// iterator is used directly to retrieve the initial value before looping
/// over the rest of the sequence.
///
///     extension Sequence {
///         func reduce1(
///             _ nextPartialResult: (Iterator.Element, Iterator.Element) -> Iterator.Element
///         ) -> Iterator.Element?
///         {
///             var i = makeIterator()
///             guard var accumulated = i.next() else {
///                 return nil
///             }
///
///             while let element = i.next() {
///                 accumulated = nextPartialResult(accumulated, element)
///             }
///             return accumulated
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `reduce1(_:)` method makes certain kinds of sequence operations
/// simpler. Here's how to find the longest string in a sequence, using the
/// `animals` array introduced earlier as an example:
///
///     let longestAnimal = animals.reduce1 { current, element in
///         if current.characters.count > element.characters.count {
///             return current
///         } else {
///             return element
///         }
///     }
///     print(longestAnimal)
///     // Prints "Butterfly"
///
/// Using Multiple Iterators
/// ========================
///
/// Whenever you use multiple iterators (or `for`-`in` loops) over a single
/// sequence, be sure you know that the specific sequence supports repeated
/// iteration, either because you know its concrete type or because the
/// sequence is also constrained to the `Collection` protocol.
///
/// Obtain each separate iterator from separate calls to the sequence's
/// `makeIterator()` method rather than by copying. Copying an iterator is
/// safe, but advancing one copy of an iterator by calling its `next()` method
/// may invalidate other copies of that iterator. `for`-`in` loops are safe in
/// this regard.
///
/// Adding IteratorProtocol Conformance to Your Type
/// ================================================
///
/// Implementing an iterator that conforms to `IteratorProtocol` is simple.
/// Declare a `next()` method that advances one step in the related sequence
/// and returns the current element. When the sequence has been exhausted, the
/// `next()` method returns `nil`.
///
/// For example, consider a custom `Countdown` sequence. You can initialize the
/// `Countdown` sequence with a starting integer and then iterate over the
/// count down to zero. The `Countdown` structure's definition is short: It
/// contains only the starting count and the `makeIterator()` method required
/// by the `Sequence` protocol.
///
///     struct Countdown: Sequence {
///         let start: Int
///
///         func makeIterator() -> CountdownIterator {
///             return CountdownIterator(self)
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `makeIterator()` method returns another custom type, an iterator named
/// `CountdownIterator`. The `CountdownIterator` type keeps track of both the
/// `Countdown` sequence that it's iterating and the number of times it has
/// returned a value.
///
///     struct CountdownIterator: IteratorProtocol {
///         let countdown: Countdown
///         var times = 0
///
///         init(_ countdown: Countdown) {
///             self.countdown = countdown
///         }
///
///         mutating func next() -> Int? {
///             let nextNumber = countdown.start - times
///             guard nextNumber > 0
///                 else { return nil }
///
///             times += 1
///             return nextNumber
///         }
///     }
///
/// Each time the `next()` method is called on a `CountdownIterator` instance,
/// it calculates the new next value, checks to see whether it has reached
/// zero, and then returns either the number, or `nil` if the iterator is
/// finished returning elements of the sequence.
///
/// Creating and iterating over a `Countdown` sequence uses a
/// `CountdownIterator` to handle the iteration.
///
///     let threeTwoOne = Countdown(start: 3)

/// Thus, creating a slice has O(1) complexity.
///
/// Slices Share Indices
/// --------------------
///
/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base
/// collection. An element of a slice is located under the same index in the
/// slice and in the base collection, as long as neither the collection nor
/// the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from
/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `MutableBidirectionalSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise
///   accessible, which can erroneously appear to be memory leakage.
///
/// - Note: `MutableBidirectionalSlice` requires that the base collection's `subscript(_: Index)`
///   setter does not invalidate indices. If you are writing a collection and
///   mutations need to invalidate indices, don't use `MutableBidirectionalSlice` as its

///
/// Slices Share Indices
/// --------------------
///
/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base
/// collection. An element of a slice is located under the same index in the
/// slice and in the base collection, as long as neither the collection nor
/// the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from
/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `MutableRandomAccessSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise
///   accessible, which can erroneously appear to be memory leakage.
///
/// - Note: `MutableRandomAccessSlice` requires that the base collection's `subscript(_: Index)`
///   setter does not invalidate indices. If you are writing a collection and
///   mutations need to invalidate indices, don't use `MutableRandomAccessSlice` as its

///
/// Slices Share Indices
/// --------------------
///
/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base
/// collection. An element of a slice is located under the same index in the
/// slice and in the base collection, as long as neither the collection nor
/// the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from
/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `MutableRangeReplaceableBidirectionalSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise
///   accessible, which can erroneously appear to be memory leakage.
///
/// - Note: `MutableRangeReplaceableBidirectionalSlice` requires that the base collection's `subscript(_: Index)`
///   setter does not invalidate indices. If you are writing a collection and
///   mutations need to invalidate indices, don't use `MutableRangeReplaceableBidirectionalSlice` as its

/// --------------------

/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base

/// the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.
///

/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `MutableSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise
///   accessible, which can erroneously appear to be memory leakage.
///
/// - Note: `MutableSlice` requires that the base collection's `subscript(_: Index)`
///   setter does not invalidate indices. If you are writing a collection and
///   mutations need to invalidate indices, don't use `MutableSlice` as its

/// your custom types lets you perform set-related operations such as

/// when implemented using specific criteria, adoption of this protocol
/// requires no extra work on your part.
///
/// When creating an option set, include a `rawValue` property in your type
/// declaration. The `rawValue` property must be of a type that conforms to
/// the `BitwiseOperations` protocol, such as `Int` or `UInt8`. Next, create
/// unique options as static properties of your custom type using unique
/// powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so forth) for each individual
/// property's raw value so that each property can be represented by a single
/// bit of the type's raw value.
///
/// For example, consider a custom type called `ShippingOptions` that is an
/// option set of the possible ways to ship a customer's purchase.
/// `ShippingOptions` includes a `rawValue` property of type `Int` that stores
/// the bit mask of available shipping options. The static members `NextDay`,

/// Using an Option Set Type
/// ========================
///
/// When you need to create an instance of an option set, assign one of the

/// create an option set instance with multiple members, assign an array
/// literal with multiple static members of the option set. To create an empty

/// never type the word `Optional`. Swift's type system usually shows the
/// wrapped type's name with a trailing question mark (`?`) instead of showing
/// the full type name. For example, if a variable has the type `Int?`, that's
/// just another way of writing `Optional<Int>`. The shortened form is
/// preferred for ease of reading and writing code.
///
/// The types of `shortForm` and `longForm` in the following code sample are
/// the same:
///
///     let shortForm: Int? = Int("42")
///     let longForm: Optional<Int> = Int("42")
///
/// The `Optional` type is an enumeration with two cases. `Optional.none` is
/// equivalent to the `nil` literal. `Optional.some(Wrapped)` stores a wrapped
/// value. For example:
///
///     let number: Int? = Optional.some(42)
///     let noNumber: Int? = Optional.none
///     print(noNumber == nil)
///     // Prints "true"
///
/// You must unwrap the value of an `Optional` instance before you can use it
/// in many contexts. Because Swift provides several ways to safely unwrap
/// optional values, you can choose the one that helps you write clear,
/// concise code.
///
/// The following examples use this dictionary of image names and file paths:
///
///     let imagePaths = ["star": "/glyphs/star.png",
///                       "portrait": "/images/content/portrait.jpg",
///                       "spacer": "/images/shared/spacer.gif"]
///
/// Getting a dictionary's value using a key returns an optional value, so
/// `imagePaths["star"]` has type `Optional<String>` or, written in the
/// preferred manner, `String?`.
///
/// Optional Binding
/// ----------------
///
/// To conditionally bind the wrapped value of an `Optional` instance to a new
/// variable, use one of the optional binding control structures, including
/// `if let`, `guard let`, and `switch`.
///
///     if let starPath = imagePaths["star"] {
///         print("The star image is at '\(starPath)'")
///     } else {
///         print("Couldn't find the star image")
///     }
///     // Prints "The star image is at '/glyphs/star.png'"
///
/// Optional Chaining
/// -----------------
///
/// To safely access the properties and methods of a wrapped instance, use the
/// postfix optional chaining operator (`?`). The following example uses
/// optional chaining to access the `hasSuffix(_:)` method on a `String?`
/// instance.
///
///     if let isPNG = imagePaths["star"]?.hasSuffix(".png") {
///         print("The star image is in PNG format")
///     }
///     // Prints "The star image is in PNG format"
///
/// Using the Nil-Coalescing Operator
/// ---------------------------------
///
/// Use the nil-coalescing operator (`??`) to supply a default value in case
/// the `Optional` instance is `nil`. Here a default path is supplied for an
/// image that is missing from `imagePaths`.
///
///     let defaultImagePath = "/images/default.png"
///     let heartPath = imagePaths["heart"] ?? defaultImagePath
///     print(heartPath)
///     // Prints "/images/default.png"
///
/// The `??` operator also works with another `Optional` instance on the
/// right-hand side. As a result, you can chain multiple `??` operators
/// together.
///
///     let shapePath = imagePaths["cir"] ?? imagePaths["squ"] ?? defaultImagePath
///     print(shapePath)
///     // Prints "/images/default.png"
///
/// Unconditional Unwrapping
/// ------------------------
///
/// When you're certain that an instance of `Optional` contains a value, you
/// can unconditionally unwrap the value by using the forced
/// unwrap operator (postfix `!`). For example, the result of the failable `Int`
/// initializer is unconditionally unwrapped in the example below.
///
///     let number = Int("42")!
///     print(number)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// You can also perform unconditional optional chaining by using the postfix
/// `!` operator.
///
///     let isPNG = imagePaths["star"]!.hasSuffix(".png")
///     print(isPNG)
///     // Prints "true"
///

/// error.

/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `RangeReplaceableBidirectionalSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise
///   accessible, which can erroneously appear to be memory leakage.

/// Thus, creating a slice has O(1) complexity.
///
/// Slices Share Indices
/// --------------------
///
/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base
/// collection. An element of a slice is located under the same index in the
/// slice and in the base collection, as long as neither the collection nor
/// the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from
/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `RangeReplaceableRandomAccessSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise
///   accessible, which can erroneously appear to be memory leakage.

///
/// Slices Share Indices
/// --------------------
///
/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base
/// collection. An element of a slice is located under the same index in the
/// slice and in the base collection, as long as neither the collection nor
/// the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.
///
/// For example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from
/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `RangeReplaceableSlice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise
///   accessible, which can erroneously appear to be memory leakage.

/// simplifies conformance to other protocols, such as `Equatable`,
/// `Comparable`, and `Hashable`.
///
/// The `RawRepresentable` protocol is seen mainly in two categories of types:
/// enumerations with raw value types and option sets.
///
/// Enumerations with Raw Values
/// ============================
///
/// For any enumeration with a string, integer, or floating-point raw type, the
/// Swift compiler automatically adds `RawRepresentable` conformance. When
/// defining your own custom enumeration, you give it a raw type by specifying
/// the raw type as the first item in the enumeration's type inheritance list.
/// You can also use literals to specify values for one or more cases.
///
/// For example, the `Counter` enumeration defined here has an `Int` raw value
/// type and gives the first case a raw value of `1`:
///
///     enum Counter: Int {
///         case one = 1, two, three, four, five
///     }
///
/// You can create a `Counter` instance from an integer value between 1 and 5
/// by using the `init?(rawValue:)` initializer declared in the
/// `RawRepresentable` protocol. This initializer is failable because although
/// every case of the `Counter` type has a corresponding `Int` value, there
/// are many `Int` values that *don't* correspond to a case of `Counter`.
///
///     for i in 3...6 {
///         print(Counter(rawValue: i))
///     }
///     // Prints "Optional(Counter.three)"
///     // Prints "Optional(Counter.four)"
///     // Prints "Optional(Counter.five)"
///     // Prints "nil"
///
/// Option Sets
/// ===========
///
/// Option sets all conform to `RawRepresentable` by inheritance using the
/// `OptionSet` protocol. Whether using an option set or creating your own,
/// you use the raw value of an option set instance to store the instance's
/// bitfield. The raw value must therefore be of a type that conforms to the
/// `BitwiseOperations` protocol, such as `UInt8` or `Int`. For example, the
/// `Direction` type defines an option set for the four directions you can
/// move in a game.
///
///     struct Directions: OptionSet {
///         let rawValue: UInt8
///
///         static let up    = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 0)
///         static let down  = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 1)
///         static let left  = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 2)
///         static let right = Directions(rawValue: 1 << 3)
///     }
///
/// Unlike enumerations, option sets provide a nonfailable `init(rawValue:)`
/// initializer to convert from a raw value, because option sets don't have an
/// enumerated list of all possible cases. Option set values have
/// a one-to-one correspondence with their associated raw values.
///
/// In the case of the `Directions` option set, an instance can contain zero,
/// one, or more of the four defined directions. This example declares a
/// constant with three currently allowed moves. The raw value of the
/// `allowedMoves` instance is the result of the bitwise OR of its three
/// members' raw values:
///
///     let allowedMoves: Directions = [.up, .down, .left]
///     print(allowedMoves.rawValue)
///     // Prints "7"
///
/// Option sets use bitwise operations on their associated raw values to
/// implement their mathematical set operations. For example, the `contains()`
/// method on `allowedMoves` performs a bitwise AND operation to check whether
/// the option set contains an element.
///
///     print(allowedMoves.contains(.right))
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(allowedMoves.rawValue & Directions.right.rawValue)
///     // Prints "0"
///
/// - SeeAlso: `OptionSet`, `BitwiseOperations`

/// A type that provides sequential, iterated access to its elements.
///
/// A sequence is a list of values that you can step through one at a time. The

/// `for`-`in` loop:
///
///     let oneTwoThree = 1...3
///     for number in oneTwoThree {
///         print(number)
///     }
///     // Prints "1"
///     // Prints "2"
///     // Prints "3"
///
/// While seemingly simple, this capability gives you access to a large number
/// of operations that you can perform on any sequence. As an example, to
/// check whether a sequence includes a particular value, you can test each
/// value sequentially until you've found a match or reached the end of the
/// sequence. This example checks to see whether a particular insect is in an
/// array.
///
///     let bugs = ["Aphid", "Bumblebee", "Cicada", "Damselfly", "Earwig"]
///     var hasMosquito = false
///     for bug in bugs {
///         if bug == "Mosquito" {
///             hasMosquito = true
///             break
///         }
///     }
///     print("'bugs' has a mosquito: \(hasMosquito)")
///     // Prints "'bugs' has a mosquito: false"
///
/// The `Sequence` protocol provides default implementations for many common
/// operations that depend on sequential access to a sequence's values. For
/// clearer, more concise code, the example above could use the array's
/// `contains(_:)` method, which every sequence inherits from `Sequence`,
/// instead of iterating manually:
///
///     if bugs.contains("Mosquito") {
///         print("Break out the bug spray.")
///     } else {
///         print("Whew, no mosquitos!")
///     }
///     // Prints "Whew, no mosquitos!"
///
/// Repeated Access
/// ===============
///
/// The `Sequence` protocol makes no requirement on conforming types regarding
/// whether they will be destructively consumed by iteration. As a
/// consequence, don't assume that multiple `for`-`in` loops on a sequence
/// will either resume iteration or restart from the beginning:
///
///     for element in sequence {
///         if ... some condition { break }
///     }
///
///     for element in sequence {
///         // No defined behavior
///     }
///
/// In this case, you cannot assume either that a sequence will be consumable
/// and will resume iteration, or that a sequence is a collection and will
/// restart iteration from the first element. A conforming sequence that is
/// not a collection is allowed to produce an arbitrary sequence of elements
/// in the second `for`-`in` loop.
///
/// To establish that a type you've created supports nondestructive iteration,
/// add conformance to the `Collection` protocol.
///
/// Conforming to the Sequence Protocol
/// ===================================
///
/// Making your own custom types conform to `Sequence` enables many useful
/// operations, like `for`-`in` looping and the `contains` method, without
/// much effort. To add `Sequence` conformance to your own custom type, add a
/// `makeIterator()` method that returns an iterator.
///
/// Alternatively, if your type can act as its own iterator, implementing the
/// requirements of the `IteratorProtocol` protocol and declaring conformance
/// to both `Sequence` and `IteratorProtocol` are sufficient.
///
/// Here's a definition of a `Countdown` sequence that serves as its own
/// iterator. The `makeIterator()` method is provided as a default
/// implementation.
///
///     struct Countdown: Sequence, IteratorProtocol {
///         var count: Int
///
///         mutating func next() -> Int? {
///             if count == 0 {
///                 return nil
///             } else {
///                 defer { count -= 1 }
///                 return count
///             }

///         print(i)
///     }

/// collection, or when you need to ensure that each element appears only once
/// in a collection.
///
/// You can create a set with any element type that conforms to the `Hashable`
/// protocol. By default, most types in the standard library are hashable,
/// including strings, numeric and Boolean types, enumeration cases without
/// associated values, and even sets themselves.
///

///
/// Set Operations
/// ==============
///
/// Sets provide a suite of mathematical set operations. For example, you can
/// efficiently test a set for membership of an element or check its
/// intersection with another set:
///
/// - Use the `contains(_:)` method to test whether a set contains a specific
///   element.
/// - Use the "equal to" operator (`==`) to test whether two sets contain the
///   same elements.
/// - Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to test whether a set contains all the
///   elements of another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to test whether all elements of a set
///   are contained in another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` and `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods to test
///   whether a set is a subset or superset of, but not equal to, another set.
/// - Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to test whether a set has any elements
///   in common with another set.
///
/// You can also combine, exclude, or subtract the elements of two sets:
///
/// - Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of a set
///   and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the
///   elements common to a set and another set or sequence.
/// - Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with the
///   elements that are in either a set or another set or sequence, but not in
///   both.
/// - Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with the elements of
///   a set that are not also in another set or sequence.
///
/// You can modify a set in place by using these methods' mutating
/// counterparts: `formUnion(_:)`, `formIntersection(_:)`,
/// `formSymmetricDifference(_:)`, and `subtract(_:)`.
///
/// Set operations are not limited to use with other sets. Instead, you can
/// perform set operations with another set, an array, or any other sequence
/// type.
///
///     var primes: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]
///
///     // Tests whether primes is a subset of a Range<Int>
///     print(primes.isSubset(of: 0..<10))
///     // Prints "true"
///
///     // Performs an intersection with an Array<Int>
///     let favoriteNumbers = [5, 7, 15, 21]
///     print(primes.intersection(favoriteNumbers))
///     // Prints "[5, 7]"
///
/// Sequence and Collection Operations
/// ==================================
///
/// In addition to the `Set` type's set operations, you can use any nonmutating
/// sequence or collection methods with a set.
///
///     if primes.isEmpty {
///         print("No primes!")
///     } else {
///         print("We have \(primes.count) primes.")
///     }
///     // Prints "We have 4 primes."
///
///     let primesSum = primes.reduce(0, +)
///     // 'primesSum' == 17
///
///     let primeStrings = primes.sorted().map(String.init)
///     // 'primeStrings' == ["2", "3", "5", "7"]
///
/// You can iterate through a set's unordered elements with a `for`-`in` loop.
///
///     for number in primes {
///         print(number)
///     }
///     // Prints "5"
///     // Prints "7"
///     // Prints "2"
///     // Prints "3"
///
/// Many sequence and collection operations return an array or a type-erasing
/// collection wrapper instead of a set. To restore efficient set operations,
/// create a new set from the result.
///
///     let morePrimes = primes.union([11, 13, 17, 19])
///
///     let laterPrimes = morePrimes.filter { $0 > 10 }
///     // 'laterPrimes' is of type Array<Int>
///
///     let laterPrimesSet = Set(morePrimes.filter { $0 > 10 })
///     // 'laterPrimesSet' is of type Set<Int>
///
/// Bridging Between Set and NSSet
/// ==============================
///
/// You can bridge between `Set` and `NSSet` using the `as` operator. For
/// bridging to be possible, the `Element` type of a set must be a class, an
/// `@objc` protocol (a protocol imported from Objective-C or marked with the
/// `@objc` attribute), or a type that bridges to a Foundation type.
///
/// Bridging from `Set` to `NSSet` always takes O(1) time and space. When the
/// set's `Element` type is neither a class nor an `@objc` protocol, any
/// required bridging of elements occurs at the first access of each element,
/// so the first operation that uses the contents of the set (for example, a
/// membership test) can take O(*n*).
///
/// Bridging from `NSSet` to `Set` first calls the `copy(with:)` method
/// (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the set to get an immutable copy and
/// then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1) time. For
/// instances of `NSSet` that are already immutable, `copy(with:)` returns the
/// same set in constant time; otherwise, the copying performance is
/// unspecified. The instances of `NSSet` and `Set` share buffer using the
/// same copy-on-write optimization that is used when two instances of `Set`
/// share buffer.

/// --------------------
///
/// Indices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base

/// each class during a session.
///
///     var absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]
///
/// You're tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second
/// half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow
/// these setps:
///
/// 1) Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the
///    days.
/// 2) Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day
///    with the most absences.
/// 3) Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original
///    `absences` array.
///
/// Here's an implementation of those steps:
///
///     let secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count / 2)
///     if let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {
///         print("Highest second-half absences: \(absences[i])")
///     }
///     // Prints "Highest second-half absences: 3"
///
/// Slices Inherit Semantics
/// ------------------------
///
/// A slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection.
/// That is, if a `Slice` instance is wrapped around a mutable
/// collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the
/// original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not
/// affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.
///
/// For example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from
/// `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.
///
///     absences[7] = 2
///     print(absences)
///     // Prints "[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]"
///     print(secondHalf)
///     // Prints "[0, 3, 1, 0]"
///
/// - Important: Use slices only for transient computation.
///   A slice may hold a reference to the entire storage of a larger
///   collection, not just to the portion it presents, even after the base
///   collection's lifetime ends. Long-term storage of a slice may therefore
///   prolong the lifetime of elements that are no longer otherwise

/// Representing Strings: Views
/// ===========================
///
/// A string is not itself a collection. Instead, it has properties that

///     // Prints "Café du 🌍"
///
/// Character View
/// --------------
///
/// A string's `characters` property is a collection of *extended grapheme
/// clusters*, which approximate human-readable characters. Many individual
/// characters, such as "é", "김", and "🇮🇳", can be made up of multiple Unicode
/// code points. These code points are combined by Unicode's boundary
/// algorithms into extended grapheme clusters, represented by Swift's

///
/// Each visible character in the `cafe` string is a separate element of the
/// `characters` view.
///
/// Unicode Scalar View
/// -------------------
///
/// A string's `unicodeScalars` property is a collection of Unicode scalar
/// values, the 21-bit codes that are the basic unit of Unicode. Each scalar
/// value is represented by a `UnicodeScalar` instance and is equivalent to a
/// UTF-32 code unit.
///
///     print(cafe.unicodeScalars.count)

///     let cLength = strlen(cafe)
///     print(cLength)
///     // Prints "14"
///
/// Counting the Length of a String
/// ===============================
///
/// When you need to know the length of a string, you must first consider what
/// you'll use the length for. Are you measuring the number of characters that
/// will be displayed on the screen, or are you measuring the amount of
/// storage needed for the string in a particular encoding? A single string
/// can have greatly differing lengths when measured by its different views.
///
/// For example, an ASCII character like the capital letter *A* is represented
/// by a single element in each of its four views. The Unicode scalar value of
/// *A* is `65`, which is small enough to fit in a single code unit in both
/// UTF-16 and UTF-8.
///
///     let capitalA = "A"
///     print(capitalA.characters.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(capitalA.unicodeScalars.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(capitalA.utf16.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(capitalA.utf8.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///
/// On the other hand, an emoji flag character is constructed from a pair of
/// Unicode scalars values, like `"\u{1F1F5}"` and `"\u{1F1F7}"`. Each of
/// these scalar values, in turn, is too large to fit into a single UTF-16 or
/// UTF-8 code unit. As a result, each view of the string `"🇵🇷"` reports a
/// different length.
///
///     let flag = "🇵🇷"
///     print(flag.characters.count)
///     // Prints "1"
///     print(flag.unicodeScalars.count)
///     // Prints "2"
///     print(flag.utf16.count)
///     // Prints "4"
///     print(flag.utf8.count)
///     // Prints "8"
///
/// To check whether a string is empty, use its `isEmpty` property instead
/// of comparing the length of one of the views to `0`. Unlike `isEmpty`,
/// calculating a view's `count` property requires iterating through the
/// elements of the string.
///
/// Accessing String View Elements
/// ==============================
///
/// To find individual elements of a string, use the appropriate view for your
/// task. For example, to retrieve the first word of a longer string, you can
/// search the `characters` view for a space and then create a new string from
/// a prefix of the `characters` view up to that point.
///
///     let name = "Marie Curie"
///     let firstSpace = name.characters.index(of: " ")!
///     let firstName = String(name.characters.prefix(upTo: firstSpace))
///     print(firstName)
///     // Prints "Marie"
///
/// You can convert an index into one of a string's views to an index into
/// another view.
///
///     let firstSpaceUTF8 = firstSpace.samePosition(in: name.utf8)
///     print(Array(name.utf8.prefix(upTo: firstSpaceUTF8)))
///     // Prints "[77, 97, 114, 105, 101]"
///
/// Performance Optimizations
/// =========================
///
/// Although strings in Swift have value semantics, strings use a copy-on-write
/// strategy to store their data in a buffer. This buffer can then be shared
/// by different copies of a string. A string's data is only copied lazily,
/// upon mutation, when more than one string instance is using the same
/// buffer. Therefore, the first in any sequence of mutating operations may
/// cost O(*n*) time and space.
///
/// When a string's contiguous storage fills up, a new buffer must be allocated
/// and data must be moved to the new storage. String buffers use an
/// exponential growth strategy that makes appending to a string a constant
/// time operation when averaged over many append operations.
///
/// Bridging between String and NSString
/// ====================================
///
/// Any `String` instance can be bridged to `NSString` using the type-cast
/// operator (`as`), and any `String` instance that originates in Objective-C
/// may use an `NSString` instance as its storage. Because any arbitrary
/// subclass of `NSString` can become a `String` instance, there are no
/// guarantees about representation or efficiency when a `String` instance is
/// backed by `NSString` storage. Because `NSString` is immutable, it is just
/// as though the storage was shared by a copy: The first in any sequence of
/// mutating operations causes elements to be copied into unique, contiguous
/// storage which may cost O(*n*) time and space, where *n* is the length of
/// the string's encoded representation (or more, if the underlying `NSString`
/// has unusual performance characteristics).

/// pointer's `Pointee` type. `UnsafeMutablePointer` provides no automated
/// memory management or alignment guarantees. You are responsible for
/// handling the life cycle of any memory you work with through unsafe
/// pointers to avoid leaks or undefined behavior.
///
/// Memory that you manually manage can be either *untyped* or *bound* to a
/// specific type. You use the `UnsafeMutablePointer` type to access and
/// manage memory that has been bound to a specific type.
///
/// Understanding a Pointer's Memory State
/// ======================================
///
/// The memory referenced by an `UnsafeMutablePointer` instance can be in
/// one of several states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to
/// pointers with memory in a specific state---you must keep track of the
/// state of the memory you are working with and understand the changes to
/// that state that different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and
/// uninitialized, bound to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and
/// initialized to a value. Finally, memory that was allocated previously may
/// have been deallocated, leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated
/// memory.
///
/// Uninitialized Memory
/// --------------------
///
/// Memory that has just been allocated through a typed pointer or has been
/// deinitialized is in an *uninitialized* state. Uninitialized memory must be
/// initialized before it can be accessed for reading.
///
/// You can use methods like `initialize(to:count:)`, `initialize(from:)`, and
/// `moveInitializeMemory(from:count)` to initialize the memory referenced by
/// a pointer with a value or series of values.
///
/// Initialized Memory
/// ------------------
///
/// *Initialized* memory has a value that can be read using a pointer's
/// `pointee` property or through subscript notation. In the following
/// example, `ptr` is a pointer to memory initialized with a value of `23`:
///
///     let ptr: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int> = ...
///     // ptr.pointee == 23
///     // ptr[0] == 23
///
/// Accessing a Pointer's Memory as a Different Type
/// ================================================
///
/// When you access memory through an `UnsafeMutablePointer` instance, the
/// `Pointee` type must be consistent with the bound type of the memory. If
/// you do need to access memory that is bound to one type as a different
/// type, Swift's pointer types provide type-safe ways to temporarily or
/// permanently change the bound type of the memory, or to load typed
/// instances directly from raw memory.
///
/// An `UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>` instance allocated with eight bytes of
/// memory, `uint8Pointer`, will be used for the examples below.
///
///     let uint8Pointer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.allocate(capacity: 8)
///     uint8Pointer.initialize(from: [39, 77, 111, 111, 102, 33, 39, 0])
///
/// When you only need to temporarily access a pointer's memory as a different
/// type, use the `withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:)` method. For example, you
/// can use this method to call an API that expects a pointer to a different
/// type that is layout compatible with your pointer's `Pointee`. The following
/// code temporarily rebinds the memory that `uint8Pointer` references from
/// `UInt8` to `Int8` to call the imported C `strlen` function.
///
///     // Imported from C
///     func strlen(_ __s: UnsafePointer<Int8>!) -> UInt
///
///     let length = uint8Pointer.withMemoryRebound(to: Int8.self, capacity: 8) {
///         return strlen($0)
///     }
///     // length == 7
///
/// When you need to permanently rebind memory to a different type, first
/// obtain a raw pointer to the memory and then call the
/// `bindMemory(to:capacity:)` method on the raw pointer. The following
/// example binds the memory referenced by `uint8Pointer` to one instance of
/// the `UInt64` type:
///
///     let uint64Pointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(uint64Pointer)
///                               .bindMemory(to: UInt64.self, capacity: 1)
///
/// After rebinding the memory referenced by `uint8Pointer` to `UInt64`,
/// accessing that pointer's referenced memory as a `UInt8` instance is
/// undefined.
///
///     var fullInteger = uint64Pointer.pointee          // OK
///     var firstByte = uint8Pointer.pointee             // undefined
///
/// Alternatively, you can access the same memory as a different type without
/// rebinding through untyped memory access, so long as the bound type and the
/// destination type are trivial types. Convert your pointer to an
/// `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` instance and then use the raw pointer's
/// `load(fromByteOffset:as:)` and `storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:)` methods
/// to read and write values.
///
///     let rawPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(uint64Pointer)
///     fullInteger = rawPointer.load(as: UInt64.self)   // OK
///     firstByte = rawPointer.load(as: UInt8.self)      // OK
///
/// Performing Typed Pointer Arithmetic
/// ===================================
///
/// Pointer arithmetic with a typed pointer is counted in strides of the
/// pointer's `Pointee` type. When you add to or subtract from an `UnsafeMutablePointer`
/// instance, the result is a new pointer of the same type, offset by that
/// number of instances of the `Pointee` type.
///
///     // 'intPointer' points to memory initialized with [10, 20, 30, 40]
///     let intPointer: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int> = ...
///
///     // Load the first value in memory
///     let x = intPointer.pointee
///     // x == 10
///
///     // Load the third value in memory
///     let offsetPointer = intPointer + 2
///     let y = offsetPointer.pointee
///     // y == 30
///
/// You can also use subscript notation to access the value in memory at a
/// specific offset.
///
///     let z = intPointer[2]
///     // z == 30
///
/// Implicit Casting and Bridging
/// =============================
///
/// When calling a function or method with an `UnsafeMutablePointer` parameter, you can pass
/// an instance of that specific pointer type or use Swift's implicit bridging
/// to pass a compatible pointer.
///
/// For example, the `printInt(atAddress:)` function in the following code
/// sample expects an `UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>` instance as its first parameter:
///
///     func printInt(atAddress p: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>) {
///         print(p.pointee)
///     }
///
/// As is typical in Swift, you can call the `printInt(atAddress:)` function
/// with an `UnsafeMutablePointer` instance. This example passes `intPointer`, a mutable
/// pointer to an `Int` value, to `print(address:)`.
///
///     printInt(atAddress: intPointer)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Alternatively, you can use Swift's *implicit bridging* to pass a pointer to
/// an instance or to the elements of an array. The following example passes a
/// pointer to the `value` variable by using inout syntax:
///
///     var value: Int = 23
///     printInt(atAddress: &value)
///     // Prints "23"
///
/// A mutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when
/// you pass the array using inout syntax. This example uses implicit bridging
/// to pass a pointer to the elements of `numbers` when calling
/// `printInt(atAddress:)`.
///
///     var numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
///     printInt(atAddress: &numbers)
///     // Prints "5"
///
/// However you call `printInt(atAddress:)`, Swift's type safety guarantees
/// that you can only pass a pointer to the type required by the function---in
/// this case, a pointer to an `Int`.
///
/// - Important: The pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance
///   or of an array's elements is only valid during the execution of the
///   called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the
///   function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit
///   bridging when calling an `UnsafeMutablePointer` initializer.
///
///       var number = 5
///       let numberPointer = UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>(&number)
///       // Accessing 'numberPointer' is undefined behavior.

///
/// Understanding a Pointer's Memory State
/// ======================================
///
/// The memory referenced by an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` instance can be in one of several
/// states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to pointers with
/// memory in a specific state---you must keep track of the state of the
/// memory you are working with and understand the changes to that state that
/// different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and uninitialized,
/// bound to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and initialized to a
/// value. Finally, memory that was allocated previously may have been
/// deallocated, leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated memory.
///
/// Raw, Uninitialized Memory
/// -------------------------
///
/// Raw memory that has just been allocated is in an *uninitialized, untyped*
/// state. Uninitialized memory must be initialized with values of a type
/// before it can be used with any typed operations.
///
/// You can use methods like `initializeMemory(as:from:)` and
/// `moveInitializeMemory(as:from:count)` to bind raw memory to a type and
/// initialize it with a value or series of values. To bind uninitialized
/// memory to a type without initializing it, use the `bindMemory(to:count:)`
/// method. These methods all return typed pointers for further typed access
/// to the memory.
///
/// Typed Memory
/// ------------
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type, whether it is initialized or
/// uninitialized, is typically accessed using typed pointers---instances of
/// `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`. Initialization, assignment,
/// and deinitialization can be performed using `UnsafeMutablePointer`
/// methods.
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type can be rebound to a different type
/// only after it has been deinitialized or if the bound type is a *trivial
/// type*. Deinitializing typed memory does not unbind that memory's type. The
/// deinitialized memory can be reinitialized with values of the same type,
/// bound to a new type, or deallocated.
///
/// - Note: A trivial type can be copied bit for bit with no indirection or
///   reference-counting operations. Generally, native Swift types that do not
///   contain strong or weak references or other forms of indirection are
///   trivial, as are imported C structs and enumerations.
///
/// When reading from or writing to  memory as raw
/// bytes when that memory is bound to a type, you must ensure that you
/// satisfy any alignment requirements.
/// Writing to typed memory as raw bytes must only be performed when the bound
/// type is a trivial type.
///
/// Raw Pointer Arithmetic
/// ======================
///
/// Pointer arithmetic with raw pointers is performed at the byte level. When
/// you add to or subtract from a raw pointer, the result is a new raw pointer
/// offset by that number of bytes. The following example allocates four bytes

///
/// Implicit Casting and Bridging
/// =============================
///
/// When calling a function or method with an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` parameter, you can pass
/// an instance of that specific pointer type, pass an instance of a
/// compatible pointer type, or use Swift's implicit bridging to pass a
/// compatible pointer.
///
/// For example, the `print(address:as:)` function in the following code sample
/// takes an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` instance as its first parameter:
///
///     func print<T>(address p: UnsafeMutableRawPointer, as type: T.Type) {
///         let value = p.load(as: type)
///         print(value)
///     }
///
/// As is typical in Swift, you can call the `print(address:as:)` function with
/// an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` instance. This example passes `rawPointer` as the initial
/// parameter.
///
///     // 'rawPointer' points to memory initialized with `Int` values.
///     let rawPointer: UnsafeMutableRawPointer = ...
///     print(address: rawPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Because typed pointers can be implicitly cast to raw pointers when passed
/// as a parameter, you can also call `print(address:as:)` with any mutable
/// typed pointer instance.
///
///     let intPointer: UnsafeMutablePointer<Int> = ...
///     print(address: intPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Alternatively, you can use Swift's *implicit bridging* to pass a pointer to
/// an instance or to the elements of an array. Use inout syntax to implicitly
/// create a pointer to an instance of any type. The following example uses
/// implicit bridging to pass a pointer to `value` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`:
///
///     var value: Int = 23
///     print(address: &value, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "23"
///
/// A mutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when
/// you pass the array using inout syntax. This example uses implicit bridging
/// to pass a pointer to the elements of `numbers` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`.
///
///     var numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
///     print(address: &numbers, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "5"
///
/// - Important: The pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance
///   or of an array's elements is only valid during the execution of the
///   called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the
///   function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit
///   bridging when calling an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer` initializer.
///
///       var number = 5
///       let numberPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(&number)
///       // Accessing 'numberPointer' is undefined behavior.

/// A pointer for accessing  data of a
/// specific type.
///
/// You use instances of the `UnsafePointer` type to access data of a
/// specific type in memory. The type of data that a pointer can access is the
/// pointer's `Pointee` type. `UnsafePointer` provides no automated
/// memory management or alignment guarantees. You are responsible for
/// handling the life cycle of any memory you work with through unsafe
/// pointers to avoid leaks or undefined behavior.
///
/// Memory that you manually manage can be either *untyped* or *bound* to a
/// specific type. You use the `UnsafePointer` type to access and
/// manage memory that has been bound to a specific type.
///
/// Understanding a Pointer's Memory State
/// ======================================
///
/// The memory referenced by an `UnsafePointer` instance can be in
/// one of several states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to
/// pointers with memory in a specific state---you must keep track of the
/// state of the memory you are working with and understand the changes to
/// that state that different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and
/// uninitialized, bound to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and
/// initialized to a value. Finally, memory that was allocated previously may
/// have been deallocated, leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated
/// memory.
///
/// Uninitialized Memory
/// --------------------
///
/// Memory that has just been allocated through a typed pointer or has been
/// deinitialized is in an *uninitialized* state. Uninitialized memory must be
/// initialized before it can be accessed for reading.
///
/// Initialized Memory
/// ------------------
///
/// *Initialized* memory has a value that can be read using a pointer's
/// `pointee` property or through subscript notation. In the following
/// example, `ptr` is a pointer to memory initialized with a value of `23`:
///
///     let ptr: UnsafePointer<Int> = ...
///     // ptr.pointee == 23
///     // ptr[0] == 23
///
/// Accessing a Pointer's Memory as a Different Type
/// ================================================
///
/// When you access memory through an `UnsafePointer` instance, the
/// `Pointee` type must be consistent with the bound type of the memory. If
/// you do need to access memory that is bound to one type as a different
/// type, Swift's pointer types provide type-safe ways to temporarily or
/// permanently change the bound type of the memory, or to load typed
/// instances directly from raw memory.
///
/// An `UnsafePointer<UInt8>` instance allocated with eight bytes of
/// memory, `uint8Pointer`, will be used for the examples below.
///
///     let uint8Pointer: UnsafePointer<UInt8> = fetchEightBytes()
///
/// When you only need to temporarily access a pointer's memory as a different
/// type, use the `withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:)` method. For example, you
/// can use this method to call an API that expects a pointer to a different
/// type that is layout compatible with your pointer's `Pointee`. The following
/// code temporarily rebinds the memory that `uint8Pointer` references from
/// `UInt8` to `Int8` to call the imported C `strlen` function.
///
///     // Imported from C
///     func strlen(_ __s: UnsafePointer<Int8>!) -> UInt
///
///     let length = uint8Pointer.withMemoryRebound(to: Int8.self, capacity: 8) {
///         return strlen($0)
///     }
///     // length == 7
///
/// When you need to permanently rebind memory to a different type, first
/// obtain a raw pointer to the memory and then call the
/// `bindMemory(to:capacity:)` method on the raw pointer. The following
/// example binds the memory referenced by `uint8Pointer` to one instance of
/// the `UInt64` type:
///
///     let uint64Pointer = UnsafeRawPointer(uint64Pointer)
///                               .bindMemory(to: UInt64.self, capacity: 1)
///
/// After rebinding the memory referenced by `uint8Pointer` to `UInt64`,
/// accessing that pointer's referenced memory as a `UInt8` instance is
/// undefined.
///
///     var fullInteger = uint64Pointer.pointee          // OK
///     var firstByte = uint8Pointer.pointee             // undefined
///
/// Alternatively, you can access the same memory as a different type without
/// rebinding through untyped memory access, so long as the bound type and the
/// destination type are trivial types. Convert your pointer to an
/// `UnsafeRawPointer` instance and then use the raw pointer's
/// `load(fromByteOffset:as:)` method to read values.
///
///     let rawPointer = UnsafeRawPointer(uint64Pointer)
///     fullInteger = rawPointer.load(as: UInt64.self)   // OK
///     firstByte = rawPointer.load(as: UInt8.self)      // OK
///
/// Performing Typed Pointer Arithmetic
/// ===================================
///
/// Pointer arithmetic with a typed pointer is counted in strides of the
/// pointer's `Pointee` type. When you add to or subtract from an `UnsafePointer`
/// instance, the result is a new pointer of the same type, offset by that
/// number of instances of the `Pointee` type.
///
///     // 'intPointer' points to memory initialized with [10, 20, 30, 40]
///     let intPointer: UnsafePointer<Int> = ...
///
///     // Load the first value in memory
///     let x = intPointer.pointee
///     // x == 10
///
///     // Load the third value in memory
///     let offsetPointer = intPointer + 2
///     let y = offsetPointer.pointee
///     // y == 30
///
/// You can also use subscript notation to access the value in memory at a
/// specific offset.
///
///     let z = intPointer[2]
///     // z == 30
///
/// Implicit Casting and Bridging
/// =============================
///
/// When calling a function or method with an `UnsafePointer` parameter, you can pass
/// an instance of that specific pointer type, pass an instance of a
/// compatible pointer type, or use Swift's implicit bridging to pass a
/// compatible pointer.
///
/// For example, the `printInt(atAddress:)` function in the following code
/// sample expects an `UnsafePointer<Int>` instance as its first parameter:
///
///     func printInt(atAddress p: UnsafePointer<Int>) {
///         print(p.pointee)
///     }
///
/// As is typical in Swift, you can call the `printInt(atAddress:)` function
/// with an `UnsafePointer` instance. This example passes `intPointer`, a pointer to
/// an `Int` value, to `print(address:)`.
///
///     printInt(atAddress: intPointer)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Because a mutable typed pointer can be implicitly cast to an immutable
/// pointer with the same `Pointee` type when passed as a parameter, you can
/// also call `printInt(atAddress:)` with an `UnsafeMutablePointer` instance.
///
///     let mutableIntPointer = UnsafeMutablePointer(mutating: intPointer)
///     printInt(atAddress: mutableIntPointer)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Alternatively, you can use Swift's *implicit bridging* to pass a pointer to
/// an instance or to the elements of an array. The following example passes a
/// pointer to the `value` variable by using inout syntax:
///
///     var value: Int = 23
///     printInt(atAddress: &value)
///     // Prints "23"
///
/// An immutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when
/// you pass the array as an argument. This example uses implicit bridging to
/// pass a pointer to the elements of `numbers` when calling
/// `printInt(atAddress:)`.
///
///     let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
///     printInt(atAddress: numbers)
///     // Prints "5"
///
/// You can also use inout syntax to pass a mutable pointer to the elements of
/// an array. Because `printInt(atAddress:)` requires an immutable pointer,
/// although this is syntactically valid, it isn't necessary.
///
///     var mutableNumbers = numbers
///     printInt(atAddress: &mutableNumbers)
///
/// However you call `printInt(atAddress:)`, Swift's type safety guarantees
/// that you can only pass a pointer to the type required by the function---in
/// this case, a pointer to an `Int`.
///
/// - Important: The pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance
///   or of an array's elements is only valid during the execution of the
///   called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the
///   function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit
///   bridging when calling an `UnsafePointer` initializer.
///
///       var number = 5
///       let numberPointer = UnsafePointer<Int>(&number)
///       // Accessing 'numberPointer' is undefined behavior.

///
/// The `UnsafeRawPointer` type provides no automated memory management, no type safety,
/// and no alignment guarantees. You are responsible for handling the life
/// cycle of any memory you work with through unsafe pointers, to avoid leaks
/// or undefined behavior.
///
/// Memory that you manually manage can be either *untyped* or *bound* to a
/// specific type. You use the `UnsafeRawPointer` type to access and
/// manage raw bytes in memory, whether or not that memory has been bound to a
/// specific type.
///
/// Understanding a Pointer's Memory State
/// ======================================
///
/// The memory referenced by an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance can be in one of several
/// states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to pointers with
/// memory in a specific state---you must keep track of the state of the
/// memory you are working with and understand the changes to that state that
/// different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and uninitialized,
/// bound to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and initialized to a
/// value. Finally, memory that was allocated previously may have been
/// deallocated, leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated memory.
///
/// Raw, Uninitialized Memory
/// -------------------------
///
/// Raw memory that has just been allocated is in an *uninitialized, untyped*
/// state. Uninitialized memory must be initialized with values of a type
/// before it can be used with any typed operations.
///
/// To bind uninitialized memory to a type without initializing it, use the
/// `bindMemory(to:count:)` method. This method returns a typed pointer
/// for further typed access to the memory.
///
/// Typed Memory
/// ------------
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type, whether it is initialized or
/// uninitialized, is typically accessed using typed pointers---instances of
/// `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`. Initialization, assignment,
/// and deinitialization can be performed using `UnsafeMutablePointer`
/// methods.
///
/// Memory that has been bound to a type can be rebound to a different type
/// only after it has been deinitialized or if the bound type is a *trivial
/// type*. Deinitializing typed memory does not unbind that memory's type. The
/// deinitialized memory can be reinitialized with values of the same type,
/// bound to a new type, or deallocated.
///
/// - Note: A trivial type can be copied bit for bit with no indirection or
///   reference-counting operations. Generally, native Swift types that do not
///   contain strong or weak references or other forms of indirection are
///   trivial, as are imported C structs and enumerations.
///
/// When reading from  memory as raw
/// bytes when that memory is bound to a type, you must ensure that you
/// satisfy any alignment requirements.
///
/// Raw Pointer Arithmetic
/// ======================
///
/// Pointer arithmetic with raw pointers is performed at the byte level. When
/// you add to or subtract from a raw pointer, the result is a new raw pointer
/// offset by that number of bytes. The following example allocates four bytes
/// of memory and stores `0xFF` in all four bytes:
///
///     let bytesPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(bytes: 4, alignedTo: 1)
///     bytesPointer.storeBytes(of: 0xFFFF_FFFF, as: UInt32.self)
///
///     // Load a value from the memory referenced by 'bytesPointer'
///     let x = bytesPointer.load(as: UInt8.self)       // 255
///
///     // Load a value from the last two allocated bytes
///     let offsetPointer = bytesPointer + 2
///     let y = offsetPointer.load(as: UInt16.self)     // 65535
///
/// The code above stores the value `0xFFFF_FFFF` into the four newly allocated
/// bytes, and then loads the first byte as a `UInt8` instance and the third
/// and fourth bytes as a `UInt16` instance.
///
/// Always remember to deallocate any memory that you allocate yourself.
///
///     bytesPointer.deallocate(bytes: 4, alignedTo: 1)
///
/// Implicit Casting and Bridging
/// =============================
///
/// When calling a function or method with an `UnsafeRawPointer` parameter, you can pass
/// an instance of that specific pointer type, pass an instance of a
/// compatible pointer type, or use Swift's implicit bridging to pass a
/// compatible pointer.
///
/// For example, the `print(address:as:)` function in the following code sample
/// takes an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance as its first parameter:
///
///     func print<T>(address p: UnsafeRawPointer, as type: T.Type) {
///         let value = p.load(as: type)
///         print(value)
///     }
///
/// As is typical in Swift, you can call the `print(address:as:)` function with
/// an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance. This example passes `rawPointer` as the initial
/// parameter.
///
///     // 'rawPointer' points to memory initialized with `Int` values.
///     let rawPointer: UnsafeRawPointer = ...
///     print(address: rawPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Because typed pointers can be implicitly cast to raw pointers when passed
/// as a parameter, you can also call `print(address:as:)` with any mutable or
/// immutable typed pointer instance.
///
///     let intPointer: UnsafePointer<Int> = ...
///     print(address: intPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
///     let mutableIntPointer = UnsafeMutablePointer(mutating: intPointer)
///     print(address: mutableIntPointer, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Alternatively, you can use Swift's *implicit bridging* to pass a pointer to
/// an instance or to the elements of an array. Use inout syntax to implicitly
/// create a pointer to an instance of any type. The following example uses
/// implicit bridging to pass a pointer to `value` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`:
///
///     var value: Int = 23
///     print(address: &value, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "23"
///
/// An immutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when
/// you pass the array as an argument. This example uses implicit bridging to
/// pass a pointer to the elements of `numbers` when calling
/// `print(address:as:)`.
///
///     let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
///     print(address: numbers, as: Int.self)
///     // Prints "5"
///
/// You can also use inout syntax to pass a mutable pointer to the elements of
/// an array. Because `print(address:as:)` requires an immutable pointer,
/// although this is syntactically valid, it isn't necessary.
///
///     var mutableNumbers = numbers
///     print(address: &mutableNumbers, as: Int.self)
///
/// - Important: The pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance
///   or of an array's elements is only valid during the execution of the
///   called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the
///   function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit
///   bridging when calling an `UnsafeRawPointer` initializer.
///
///       var number = 5
///       let numberPointer = UnsafeRawPointer(&number)
///       // Accessing 'numberPointer' is undefined behavior.

/// The following example declares the `stream` variable as an optional
